###15 - Object Oriented Programming paradigm and class definitions



1. Lecture! - shut up and listen to what i have to say!! (25 min)     
    a. What have we been doing thus far and is that OOP?    
    b. Classes we've already been using    
    c. Quick peak into object hierarchy, inspect object    
    d. Redefining or re-implementing int class    
    e. '__init__' constructor / factory, the pesky 'self'
    f. Could we re-implement a container class such as a list? 
    g. [What are these '__dunder__' or magic methods?](http://www.rafekettler.com/magicmethods.html) 
    h. Operator overloading when defining classes      
    i. Is-a / Has-a verbage to describe object hierarchy
    j. Disambiguation of terms: attributes, properties, methods, etc.    

2. Modeling the real world - what can we code up into our digital picnic basket? (45 min)    
    a. Why define a new class as opposed to assigning to a name of existing class?    
    b. Let's do that    
    c. Discussion: when to and when to not use classes    
    d. Advantages of user-defined class, advantages of digital v. real world object    

3. Advanced topics    
    a. Decorators and Desciptors    
    b. Quick terminology: instance methods v. class methods v. static methods

-Zed says: classes are much like modules     
-self is so the interpreter distinguish a class attribute from a local namespace
