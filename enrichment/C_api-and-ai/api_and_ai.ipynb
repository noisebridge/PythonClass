    "## APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "_If you remember back all the way to lesson 1, the very first thing we did in this class was post a status to the social media site Mastodon using its API._\n",
    "\n",
    "API stands for \"Application Programming Interface\". It is generally any mechanism by which your program can interact with another program, application, system or server. APIs can be **local** or **remote**. A local API, for example, is the Python Database API. It is a standard way of interacting with a database, but the code runs on the computer where you are running your Python code. On the other hand, a remote API lets you interact with a program or server that is running on a different computer than yours. For example, you could use the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps) to query restaurants in the vincinity of a coordinate that your program generates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will be discussing remote APIs, as a way of interacting with a remote service or application.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API defines the way your program interacts with the program providing the API. This could include mechanisms for authenticating yourself, what kind of network calls you should make to invoke a remote function, the format of data that will be returned in a successful response, what to expect if there is an error, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of services on the web that you might wish to interact with in your programs, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Google Maps\n",
    "1. Google Drive\n",
    "1. Dropbox\n",
    "1. YouTube\n",

    "### API keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every intersting API operates using **API keys**. An API key is a token that you present to the API when making a request, so that the program on the other end can identify you (authentication) and decide which resources you're allowed to access (authorization). APIs commonly have **rate limits** which restrict how many requests you can make, like \"100 requests per minute\" or \"1000 requests per day\".\n",

You should never store an API key in a version control system like git, but it's usually okay to have them sitting around on your computer.\n",

    "## Calling APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Most APIs nowadays are what we call [RESTful APIs](https://blog.postman.com/rest-api-examples/). There are a lot of minutae around what does and does not qualify as RESTful, but it's not terribly important. The key feature of a RESTful API is that it is accessed over HTTP (the same protocol that web browsers use). This is convenient because HTTP requests are easy to make from Python, and has the added benefit that in many cases you can browse or debug API responses by simply using your web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call a RESTful API simply by making HTTP requests and parsing the returned data (which is usually [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) but sometimes [XML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction)).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the case of larger APIs provided by a big company or service, there is likely a library we can download/install that will make things simpler by abstracting the HTTP requests and providing objects that represent the most interesting data structures. It's usually easier to use a library (sometimes called an SDK) provided by the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we install the `google-api-python-client` library (which I've installed in sfpythonlab.com) and use that. This code comes directly from the Google/YouTube docs on how to call this precise method.\n"
