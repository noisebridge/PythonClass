  THE
  ASTOUNDING
  CRIME
  ON
  TORRINGTON
  ROAD




PART I

 _At the request of Mr. Andrew H. Barnes I make the following statement
 in order to explain how it came about that I entered into the
 arrangement for taking down from his dictation an Account of a Certain
 Extraordinary Affair._

  HORACE MCCLINTOCK


My name is signed above. I am a staff reporter on one of the town
papers. New York, I mean. Several times in the past three or four
years when some special work in my line—which has come to be mostly
interviewing—was required there, they have sent me over to Boston.

This last time I went over—which is now, for I am there yet—I was
particularly glad to get the assignment, as my friend Dudley Knapp had
recently made a shift from a big Life Insurance Company in the West to
a very much bigger one in Boston, and it was a great pleasure to see
him.

Duds (his schoolboy name still sticks with me and I forgot to state
that we were boys together in a small town in northern Ohio) has got to
be quite a “high up” in the Insurance line. I don’t know exactly what
they call him, but he’s an expert of some kind, and is a sharp one on
any fraud or tangle that has to be attended to. I don’t mean to say
he’s a detective or anything like that, but in nine cases out of ten
he saves them from having to get one. He has the gift of knowing a man
pretty well when he gets a good look at him—with a little conversation
thrown in—and they put him on cases that have the look of being a bit
off color. There’s plenty of that kind in the Life business. That’s how
he happened to be in Boston, and we got ahold of each other almost the
minute I arrived there.

We’d been having dinner together in the men’s café at a specially good
hotel—one of the few cafés left where they hadn’t let women and dancing
in and changed the name to the Wild Rose Room or something like that,
and where—as Dudley put it—you could still get a feed without having
girls’ legs flashed in your face with every mouthful.

It was down to coffee and cigars—that is, cigars for Duds and
cigarettes for me—and we were lolling back talking over our
experiences, when I happened to think of an odd thing that occurred
on my last trip over—which was before Duds had made the shift to the
Boston Company; and I started in to give him an idea of it by asking if
he knew anything about a suburb called Roxbury.

“No,” he said, “but for God’s sake” (lowering his voice) “don’t let
anyone hear you call it a suburb—you’d be mobbed.”

“Well it looked like that to me,” I returned. “I struck a place where I
thought I was out on a farm.”

“When was this?” he asked.

“About a year ago.”

“What were you doing?”

“Following a man.”

“Who was it?”

“Never found out.”

Dudley looked at me a couple of seconds; then settling back in his
chair struck a match and began to light a cigar.

“Anything—er—out of the way?” he mumbled between puffs.

“No,” I told him, “just odd, that’s all. Peculiar way a couple of
people acted on the train coming over got me guessing to that degree
that when we arrived here about eleven o’clock at night I trailed the
man through the south station till he got into a taxi, and then jumped
into one myself and followed him out into that Roxbury region looking
for the answer—which I never got.”

“Slipped you, did he?”

“Amounted to that. Went into an old house out there—gloomy-looking
place—long way back from the road—no other houses near. I had him down
for some sort of a yegg, and when I saw him go into that murky old
mansion I called it a day and quit.”

“What made you think he was crooked?”

“One or two things I overheard on the train—and then he played a few
queer games when I was trailing him in the taxi.”

“Get the address?”

“There wasn’t any number at the gate, but I got the name of the
street on a lamp post. Not sure what it was, though. Something like
Torreytown—or Torringtown—or one of those——” I broke off suddenly.

Duds gave me a quick look.

“Table behind you!” I muttered.

“What’s the matter with it?” he grunted, his voice down with mine.

“Man got a shock when I mentioned that street.”

“Maybe he lives on it.”

I shook my head slightly.

“Well, go on—what do you care?”

I was just going to speak when Duds stopped me.

“Wait a minute!” he said, his voice down several pegs more. “That
street you mentioned—I’ve read about it somewhere—in some paper.”

“About the street?”

“Yes—or—or something that happened on it. Remember there was a lot of
excitement—everybody guessing. What did we get from Boston along then?”

“One of their murders most likely—if it was something you read about
outside.”

“Hold on—I’m getting it! It was that case the police tried to hush
up—lot of queer stuff to it—everybody wondering what in God’s name it
was all about. Inventor in it somewhere—don’t you remember that? It was
first-page stuff all over the country.”

“No—they had me down in Panama after that Boston trip, covering a
Senate Investigating Committee. Saw some headings but didn’t know what
it was all about.”

“Peculiar case all right. What was it you overheard on the train?”

“Began at the Grand Central. I was running for the five-eleven Boston
express—P.M. I needn’t say. Just as I got to the gate an excited old
woman—poorly dressed—queer hat on sideways—dangling gray hair and all
that—came hurrying across from somewhere and plunged in ahead of me
trying to pass the gateman. He held her up for a ticket of course,
and there was quite a time, she calling out that her son was on the
train—she’d got to speak to him—he had no business to be there, and
a flood of talk like that. It made a kind of a riot—for the gateman
put her down as crazy and didn’t like to pass her in among the rolling
stock; and in a minute there was a crowd of people about, and a
station policeman coming over on the run, and the assistant station
master arriving a second or two later: with the result that the two of
them—the station master and the policeman—took her through and down the
incline to the train, to see if she really had a son on board.

“She was a queer old thing, this dame, and kept mumbling to herself
that she wasn’t going to let him (her son, I took it) go to _that
place_—not if she could help it. The officer tried two or three times
to fix her hat on straight as they walked along, one on each side of
her—but it wouldn’t stay.

“Most of the passengers who came along while the old woman was blocking
the left-hand passage of the gate—where I was—were passed in on the
other side; there’s two ticket punchers, you know. But I hung back till
they took her through, and then followed them down to the train and
through the cars. Wanted to see if there was anything to it. Might be a
story if I followed it up.

“After they’d gone through nearly the whole train, including the
Pullmans, she spotted the chap she was after in the first coach
forward, next behind the smoker, and commenced to call out to him to
get off and come home with her. He was a decent-appearing young chap,
but what struck me as peculiar was that his face didn’t show the least
surprise or anger or even annoyance when he saw his mother—in fact, it
didn’t show anything at all. He shook his head a little when the old
woman told him to get off, but he wouldn’t budge, and finally when the
station master told her she’d have to leave the coach or go along with
it, she plumped down in the seat with him and a few seconds later the
train was under way.

“The nearest seat I could get was in with another man next behind. I’d
have preferred to be in front—you know how well you can hear people
sitting behind you in a car—but the whole seat was occupied. So I sat
down there behind them in the aisle seat (the other man was next the
window) and getting out a newspaper, leaned forward as far as I could
as though trying to get a good light on it, and keeping an ear turned
in the right direction to catch anything they might say.

“We must have passed Stamford before a word was spoken by either of
them, but along near that place the old woman opened up suddenly and
began remonstrating—I judged by the tone (her voice was too low to
catch any words) with tremendous earnestness. She hadn’t been talking
long though, when something he muttered got her excited and she raised
her voice enough for me to hear, ‘Well you’re goin’ to get off this
train the next place they stop at an’ come home—yes ye be Jamie—I won’t
have you goin’ on with this—I won’t have it!’

“‘Listen here!’ Jamie said under his breath but with an earnestness
that carried it over the back of the seat to me: ‘I got an A-1
situation as butler an’ general house man!’

“‘An’ don’t I know how you came by it? It’s them same people in that
agency! Look at the trouble they’ve got you into, Jamie! Wasn’t you
arrested twice an’ wasn’t it them who——’

“‘Aw, can that! Didn’t they push me into some o’ the finest houses
there was—an’ didn’t I get recommendations that takes me anywheres?’

“‘First off they did but sense then there’s nothin’ but trouble—an’ you
comin’ nigh to bein’ put in Sing Sing!’

“‘Well I wasn’t, was I?’

“‘—An’ one dreadful mess after another—an’ put with people you’d ought
ter know better’n to _be_ with! Don’t ye s’pose I know ’em, with your
father what he was! I tell you I ain’t goin’ to have it!’ (Her voice
rising into a loud wail.) ‘_You got to stop, Jamie. You got to git off
this train an’ come back home with me! You_ ——’

“‘Quiet down, can’t ye—people might get it!’

“There was silence between the two for a while, and I noticed, as the
train was running into the Bridgeport station—the first stop after One
Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street—that Jamie was watching for something
out of the window, his quick glance shifting up and down the west-bound
tracks.

“The old woman got to her feet as the train came to a stop, and told
him he must come with her and get the next train back. But he pulled
her down into the seat again—not roughly but rather protectingly in a
way—saying as he did, ‘Not here, Jenny! We can get a better train out
of New Haven.’

“‘You’ll come then?’ the old woman asked.

“‘Sure,’ said Jamie.

“She seemed greatly relieved.

“He had a time-table, and studied it for quite a while, and as we
neared New Haven (the next stop) he kept the same keen watch on the
west-bound tracks as he’d done at Bridgeport. But this time he saw what
he wanted, for there was a New York Express three or four tracks over,
roaring and sizzling to get away. It was No. 21 from Boston, and as
luck would have it, running nine minutes late. He had his mother up and
at the door before our train had come to a standstill, and they were
off the car in a jiffy and disappearing down the stairway—for he had to
cross to the New York tracks in a subway. It was an even bet whether he
made it or not, and I got off the train—keeping close to it, though,
in case it started—and ran along the platform trying to find a place
where I could see across into the windows of the other train—there were
roofs or something that cut off the view here and there. Just as I came
about opposite to the last coach of the New York Express I got a view
through, and saw them in that car, walking down the aisle looking for a
seat,—so I knew they’d made it. Jamie was carrying his heavy valise—the
old woman close herding on him as the cattle men say.

“It was only a few seconds after they got aboard when No. 21, after
hissing contemptuously a few times as the brakes went on and off, got
under way for New York.

“The train I was on—the Boston train—left the station about five
minutes later, and I was sitting down, nursing my balked curiosity
and the story that didn’t pan, when it dawned on me that I had a seat
reserved in one of the Pullmans, which, in the case of this train, were
trailing at the rear with the dining car. So I got my bag and started
back to find it.

“I had to go through several coaches before reaching the parlor cars,
and as I was walking down the aisle of the last one I suddenly caught
sight of Jamie sitting quietly in a seat on my left.—Sat there as if
he’d never been off the train.”

“Take it that’s the man you followed?”

“The very one. Kept an eye on him through the station when we got
in—South Station, not Back Bay—and when he took a taxi and drove off I
skipped into another and slipped the driver a ten to keep his machine
in sight but not get up too close. When Jamie’s taxi had led us six or
eight blocks out Columbus or Huntington or one of those avenues, it
made a sudden turn and shot around a corner to the right. Then there
were more corners right and left until you couldn’t even tell where
the State House was, but my man was on the job and kept behind like a
shadow with a string to it.

“All of a sudden he ran up to the curb and jumped off, coming to the
door. ‘If it’s the fare ye want out o’ that car, he’s payin’ off and
goin’ into the station.’ ‘What station?’ I asked. ‘North,’ says he,
‘down there where all them lights is. He’s on to us, an’ he’ll wait
long enough to make ye think he’s took a train, an’ then git a taxi
in there where they go in—out o’ sight. I got ye where ye can keep a
squint on ’em as they come out. He’s liable to stoop down or cover up
his face. Ye might know him by that.’

“And sure enough that’s just what happened. In, say, half an hour (he
waited inside that long) we were after him again, but this time keeping
so far away that he must have thought he’d thrown us off, for we got
out into a sort of country region—houses far back into grounds and that
sort of thing—most of ’em dark, too—people gone to bed.

“At a corner out there, where Jamie’s taxi had made a turn to the
right, my driver stopped before rounding it and listened, as he’d been
doing since we’d got to where it was quiet. Rather suddenly he jumped
off and hurried on to the corner, and after one look came running back
and told me the other machine had pulled up near a street lamp some
distance down the road and the fare was paying off. I got out and told
him to wait for me—that I’d walk down a bit and look around.

“I edged along at the side of the road and could see that Jamie had
gone in at a gate or entrance; and very soon the taxi that brought him
went plunging by on its way back to town. After some careful work to
keep in the shadow, I came to the old gate, or rather old posts—there
wasn’t any gate—and looking up the weedy and overgrown drive (I could
see it for a little way by the light of the street lamp) I made out
the black bulk of what must have been a large house back in among
trees, and gloomy as a prison. There was a pale yellowish light in one
window—that was all.

“While I was trying to make out something in the dense gloom, a door of
the house opened, the dim light showing through it from inside, and the
form of a man—which must have been Jamie—could be seen passing in, the
door closing quickly after him. That’s all there was to it. I told you
the rest. Got the name of the street when I went back to the corner.”

“Taxi there all right?”

“Yes—but I didn’t see it at first. Chauffeur had backed up into some
private grounds so the other driver, rattling by toward the city,
wouldn’t see him.

“‘I don’t know what your man that you’re trailin’ amounts to,’ he said
as I got in, ‘but that ain’t no amateur what run him out here!’”

“Strikes me you picked a pretty good one yourself,” observed Dudley.

“I sure did,” I agreed; “and his parting words put the flag on it.
When I’d paid him off at the hotel he stood looking at me with a queer
twist to his face and then gave a quick glance about. ‘Say, cap,’ he
said, moving quite close, ‘I don’t know as it’s any use to ye, but we
was shadowed too.’ And he was gone before I could——”

I stopped in the midst of what I was saying. The man who’d been sitting
behind Duds—the one who’d started slightly when I mentioned the name
Torringtown—was standing beside our table. I hadn’t noticed him come up.

“Pardon this intrusion, gentlemen,” the stranger said in a low voice
and with a most courteous inflection, “but it was impossible to avoid
overhearing what you were saying. I should hardly have thought it wise
to trouble you with an apology for this, but it occurred to me that the
very remarkable coincidence involved might possibly be of some slight
interest.”

We’d both risen as he began to speak, and now assured him that the
apology was unnecessary and that the coincidence would interest us in
the extreme, and begged him to be seated. But he shook his head in a
manner to convey that what he had to say would only take a moment.

On the first glance the man wasn’t remarkable in any way that I could
see: medium height—medium weight—medium age—no particular expression to
his face. But in an instant it was different, for he’d hardly begun to
speak before I felt—and so did Dudley as he told me afterward—that a
person of powerful or compelling character stood before us. Powerful in
some peculiar way. I never took much stock in hypnotism and don’t now;
at the same time I can see how things like that, carried a bit further,
might put a man where he couldn’t see straight. These things occurred
to me afterward—I couldn’t have got away, at the time, from what the
fellow was talking about.

He went on at once, after declining our invitation to sit down: “A
few moments ago I heard, from the direction of your table, the name
of a street which is intimately associated with an affair I’ve been
investigating for nearly two years.”

Something made me murmur, without the slightest intention of doing so,
“Torringtown Road.”

“That was it—not quite the correct name, but so near that I shuddered
with the fear that other parties were looking up the same case—which
would, of course, head my work for the discard. With that fear in mind
I was unable to prevent myself from listening. I am sorry.”

We both begged him not to speak of such a thing as no offense could
possibly be taken, and I asked him to tell me the right name of the
street.

“Torrington Road,” he answered. “Of course I saw in a moment—or rather
heard—that although the case was the same that I’d been working on, you
gentlemen were making no special drive at it. But in addition to thus
dispelling my anxiety, the few words I overheard supplied me with the
answer to the only question that has completely baffled me up to the
present time. For two years I’ve been making fruitless efforts to find
out who shadowed Jamie Dreek from the South Station in Boston to the
old mansion in Roxbury on that August night, and what object he could
have had in view, seeing that nothing ever came of it; and this evening
I happen to drop in for dinner at a place I’ve never patronized before,
and the answer comes across to me from the next table!”

We agreed that it was a strange coincidence, all right, and as he
seemed to be on the point of withdrawing I asked him—more to detain him
than anything else, for it seemed that he must be charged up to the
muzzle with interesting stuff—if he happened to know how it was the
Dreek chap was sitting in a coach on the Boston train after I’d seen
him go out of New Haven on the New York express.

“Very simple,” Barnes answered. “He sat with his mother as the New York
train went down through the yards, and after it got headway enough for
the old woman to feel easy about him, he shoved a wad of bills into her
lap, saying, ‘Hold that for me, will ye—I want to go to the smoker,’
walked back to the rear platform, and a second later let himself down
by the knuckle of the coupler, which projected a few inches, and
dropped off. His mother saw his valise in the rack and didn’t worry. It
was somewhere along under the Cedar Street bridge and they don’t get
into any speed by then, so he was up in a second or two and sprinting
back for the Boston train—the one you were on” (looking at me).
“Nothing much at stake you see, as he could have got No. 30 four hours
later if he’d missed it. But he didn’t. You must have noted the fact
that you can always make a train if there’s no special need of it.”

He was getting out a pocketbook as he talked, and laying a card on the
table, murmured something about his name being Barnes and that he was
taking the liberty of introducing himself; whereupon we very informally
introduced each other. And the man, who appeared to be in a hurry, was
just turning away as Dudley mentioned the fact (having given my name)
that I was a staff reporter on a New York Daily.

Upon this Mr. Barnes rather abruptly turned back and stood looking at
me.

“May I accept your recent invitation to sit down?” he asked, after a
moment.

We begged him to do so, and all three seated ourselves.

“I was concerned in this West Roxbury affair,” he said in a lowered
voice, “in a way that gave me an insight into some of its unusual
features.”

“Detective?” asked Dudley, also sinking his voice.

“Not at all,” Mr. Barnes replied. “To be perfectly frank with you—as
it’s only right I should be in view of the favor I’m going to ask—I was
associated in a confidential way with the defense. Hard put to it for
evidence they were, and I was able to turn up some for them. But the
case was so extraordinary that after it was all over I began looking
into various points that came up, and one thing led to another until I
found I was in deep and moreover so interested that I couldn’t quit.
Besides that, it began to look to me like a gold mine if it was handled
right. Although the papers were full of it at the time, not only here
in Boston but throughout the States and Canada, the real facts at the
bottom of it never came to light—a case of ‘diplomatic suppression’ by
the police, if I may be allowed to use the expression.”

“How gold mine?” asked Dudley.

“Publication,” answered Barnes. “I now have virtually the whole thing;
and some of it is bound to stir up the animals a bit. I wouldn’t have
thought of troubling you with all this but for hearing you say that Mr.
McClintock is a reporter. I’m hoping you can give me a little advice,
Mr. McClintock, on getting the thing into book form. I have it all in
my mind, and notes and memoranda to keep it there. But I’ve got to get
some one to write it down for me, as that’s something entirely out of
my line.”

“What you want, Mr. Barnes,” I said, “is a literary chap—some one in
the fiction line—a story writer.”

“Pardon me, Mr. McClintock, but that’s the very thing I don’t want.
I’ve spent a considerable amount of time—not to speak of some money—in
digging up the truth about this affair; and after all this to have it
get into the hands of a story writer and be labeled on every page as
a cheap concoction of his brain would be a calamity. I don’t want any
‘our hero’ and ‘dear reader’ and that sort of throw-down in the account
of this Haworth case, nor any ‘Foreword’ or dedication to somebody
whose loving care has helped me through or sustained me in hours of
anguish. Everything that’s going into this book I saw, or heard, or got
first-hand from the parties concerned. And as you’re in that line Mr.
McClintock, I thought perhaps you could put me in the way of finding a
reporter of the kind I need, who’d take it down the way I give it to
him, the same as he would for a newspaper. I’m asking a great favor,
but if you haven’t anyone in mind don’t hesitate to say so.”

I considered for a little, but finally had to tell him that at the
moment I couldn’t think of anyone available for such a piece of work.

He rose apologetically, but hesitated an instant as he stood there.

“I don’t suppose there’s a chance of its appealing to you?” he asked,
looking me full in the face; and went on before I could open my mouth
to answer: “It would net you three thousand, and as you don’t know me
I’m perfectly willing to pay for each quarter of the work in advance.”

By this time I’d recovered speech, and after expressing appreciation of
his liberal offer, told him it would be impossible for me to accept as
I had a regular staff job and didn’t want to lose it.

“Why lose it?” he asked, seating himself again as he spoke. “Your
work with me would scarcely take ten days, for you’d have the idea in
your notebooks as fast as I could talk it off. You can take your time
writing it out—not the least hurry about that. And if your managing
editor doesn’t want to give you the time off, I can follow you round
and manage it evenings or whenever you had an hour or so to spare.”

I was in a most peculiar mental condition, with this glittering chance
to reach up and pull down three thousand dollars, and with Mr. Barnes’s
impelling personality seeming almost to force me into the arrangement
without any consideration whatever. I tried to pull myself together and
shake off something that seemed like a “spell,” and in doing so caught
sight of Dudley, whose chair was near but slightly back of mine. All
through this talk about my doing the work I’d felt a consciousness of
his sitting there quietly smoking, and wasn’t surprised, as I glanced
about, to hear him say:

“Why rush this?”

Mr. Barnes instantly disclaimed any idea of wishing to do so,
explaining that as I’d appeared to show some slight interest in the
matter, he’d been tremendously anxious to get before me whatever
advantages it might possess.

“Let’s have a look at the disadvantages,” countered Dudley. “Suppose
Mr. McClintock, on taking up the work (if he does that) finds, for one
reason or another, that he’d rather not go on with it.”

“He’ll be at perfect liberty to discontinue,” was Barnes’s quick
rejoinder. “I’ll say,” he added, “that at any time before the first
quarter of the work is finished he may abandon it without even
troubling to give a reason.”

Shortly after this we adjourned the conference to Dudley’s
apartment—not far distant; and it was finally left that I’d have
a night to think it over and that Barnes was to meet us at the
Subtreasury the next day at four in the afternoon.

       *       *       *       *       *

“Think he’s straight?” I asked Duds, after we’d heard the elevator door
clang to with Barnes going down in the car.

“Put a question mark to that,” grunted Dudley as he lit his pipe. “But
I’ll say this,” he added a minute later, “if he isn’t, there’s nothing
he’d stop at.” He reflected awhile and then went on: “Uncommon specimen
I must say.... Strange sort of influence, too.... If he’d had you there
alone you’d be writing his book for him now.”

We sat smoking for some little time before Duds made further
observations. I waited patiently, realizing the value of his advice
in such a matter. After a while he spoke up in the manner of having
arrived at conclusions.

“On the first shot I don’t see where he could get you,” he said.
“Blackmail’s out of it. Robbery’s out of it. Playing this game to get
a hook in you for another is out of it. Of course he didn’t come into
that restaurant by any chance or accident.”

“No?”

“Not on the cat’s pajamas—or whatever it is they say. Wouldn’t be
surprised if he followed you over from New York.”

“Why not talk to me there?”

“Can’t say, but he had his reasons. Nothing accidental goes with
him.... All the same, what of it? If there’s anything criminal about
his stuff, you can quit.... If he’s cribbed it somewhere, that doesn’t
touch you. Another thing: if you do it I’m going to sit in with you.
If Barnes objects, he’s crooked and that ends it. Lot of things I
don’t like about the man, from his one-sided smile to something damned
peculiar back in his eyes. And I don’t take much stock in his book, or
whatever it is. Most likely a blind to cover a job he’s got on hand.
Rather interesting to know what it’s all about, eh?——If he talks all
right to-morrow, suppose we go ahead and see what he’s got!”

Mr. Barnes certainly did talk all right the next day, and not only
raised no objections to the presence of Dudley while the dictating
was going on, but seemed quite enormously pleased at the proposal,
explaining that with two of us he’d be able to get his mind off the
dictation business—which, to tell the truth, had rather alarmed him—and
run it off on the idea of simply giving us an account of the affair.

I phoned the office, and my managing editor gave me a week or ten days,
which Mr. Barnes said would do. The working time was arranged to suit
Dudley, as his affairs couldn’t be shifted. Always we had the evenings,
and frequently the afternoons as well. The place was the living room of
Dudley’s apartment.

Mr. Barnes made it a part of the agreement that I should write out a
brief statement of the episode of my trailing of Jamie Dreek, and our
chance meeting with him (Barnes) in the restaurant,—this to serve as
an explanation of his dictating the account of the affair to me. He
suggested also that in this statement I make mention of the fact that
because of the incidents he proposed to relate being actual happenings
with actual people involved in them, he felt it necessary in some cases
to use fictitious names and addresses.

This and the preceding pages constitute my effort to comply with Mr.
Barnes’s wishes.




PART II

 _The following Account of a Series of Occurrences in the Jamaica Plain
 District of Boston during the year 1920, and Certain Facts Relating
 Thereto, was dictated by Mr. Andrew H. Barnes, who claims to be one
 of the Only Two Persons now living who have a knowledge of the True
 Solution of the Affair. The Recital of these things as set forth by
 him is in the main Correctly Reported. The Language Used is as close
 an approach to his own as could be managed with the rapid stenography
 required._

  H. McC.


People who didn’t know—and let me tell you at the start that few
did—could hardly avoid the supposition, on being shown into the
offices of the Messrs. Harker & Pentecost, that they were entering
the headquarters of a long-established, prosperous firm, evidently of
high standing and doing a conservative and wisely managed business.
Conclusions such as these are by no means beyond what furniture,
fittings, and employees are able to convey, and Mr. Pentecost had
seen to it that all these things had done a part toward so conveying
it. Everything of the best quality, and more important still, not
new—nothing to suggest the flashily fine furnishings so often
associated with flashily conducted business.

Three years and three months before this time at which I’m calling your
attention to the firm’s office, they didn’t have any, and Mr. Hugo
Pentecost had Mr. Stephen W. Harker in such a double-twisted strangle
grip that it was either hand over whatever price the former named or
the latter went to jail. There was only one answer to that, and when
Mr. Harker said, “Name the loot, you bastard,” expecting a response of,
“I’ll take the pot!” he was considerably surprised to get no answer at
all.

Pentecost—bullet-headed—regarded him with glassy, half-closed eyes.

Harker—slim, dapper, perfectly dressed, with a pleasant, attractive
face (which was a pearl without price in his business) finally broke
the silence.

“What’s masticating you?” he said. “You’ve got me cold, haven’t you? Go
on an’ give it a name!”

Pentecost spoke in a low, soft voice. “I’ll take the business,” he said.

“One minute, George. I’m on to you from the send-off—see? You’re the
guy that drops down on the boys when they’ve been working hard for
it an’ rakes ’em for ninety per cent! Quite a name you’ve made for
yourself! Know what they call you in the Mercer Street joints? ‘The
Vulture’—that’s what they’ve put on you!”

“Fitting, too,” was the quiet rejoinder. “Vultures prey on the dead
ones.”

“I can cough twenty grand. Do you want it?”

“You can cough forty-six, but I don’t want it. The business will do for
the present.”

“Get to hell with it. My business is _my_ business. Where do you cop
the idea I can pass it around?”

“No passing around—I declare myself in.”

Harker—a man seldom surprised and never showing it—stood looking at
Pentecost, amazement concealed behind his “dead” face.

“In on my game?” he finally asked.

Pentecost nodded slightly. “But not as you play it, my friend,” he said.

       *       *       *       *       *

Harker was a successful fake promoter. Anything was grist for his mill
that was slick enough in operation to catch the public fancy or timely
enough to ride on the crest of a craze. Cheap novelties in medicine,
food, housekeeping utensils, electric refrigerating and washing
machines, oil-burning heaters,—anything attractive enough to sell
stock on—that was the sole requirement. The organization of promoting
companies—vast newspaper advertisements for a few days—window displays
when it was an operating device of some kind; and after the crop from
stock sales had been skillfully gathered in, came the little matter of
the company paying for the patent or a factory site or whatever it was,
and of course it took all the money realized on stock sales to do this;
and as Harker was the man who happened to own the patent or factory
site, he was naturally the person who sold it to the company, and there
he was.

But he wasn’t there for long. That was the chief inconvenience
connected with this simple method of relieving the
“one-born-every-minute” crowd of their superfluous capital. It
compelled the practitioner to travel for his health after every
operation. Often, too, he had to change his name as well as the
climate, and to make some drastic alteration in what might be referred
to as his identity.

The reward, though, was frequently of large proportions, which it
happened to be in the case I’m speaking of. And the vulture Pentecost,
soaring above the vast and darkened stretches of crookdom, got the odor
of tainted money and began circling nearer and nearer and eventually
sunk his talons into Mr. Harker and found that he was good. Also that
his game was well enough—indeed might be quite a big one if properly
run—the effective method of playing it flashing instantly through his
mind. He observed, too, that Harker was a skillful operator; also a
good looker as a figurehead for an important and high-class concern. He
had planned for some time to have an office to work from. So it came to
be a partnership. No papers of course—just understood. Harker was to
run his line of work in the office of the firm—after that work had been
put on Pentecost’s basis. Pentecost would have the partnership and the
office to give him solidity and standing in his own line of nefarious
and frequently hazardous undertakings. He could, without trouble, pick
up many things in Harker’s way and turn them over to him; and Harker
could give him assistance in his own affairs, should he require it.
They would divide at fifty-fifty.

Before he took to vulturizing again Pentecost gave his attention to
the rearrangement of the Harker game. An office that was “the thing”
was found in precisely the locality required, and in a modest but
high-class building. When it came to the matter of furnishings, not an
item escaped him. Being thoroughly aware that the various articles in a
room have voices and can cry out, he took good care to have only those
which would use the tones that he wanted.

Having now an office which would eloquently lie for them, the next
thing in Mr. Pentecost’s scheme of operation was to secure a business
reputation that would do the same. With this in view he and Harker went
after inventions or devices for the firm to take hold of and exploit,
that had some degree of solid merit. At the end of a year they had been
able to get only two, in each case having to purchase from a company
that was running it at a profit. Expensive deals, but both men were
plungers. They found another during the second year, and that made
three, which was enough. Companies were organized for each and the
business carried on with success and profit, large dividends going out
to the stockholders; the firm, however, on account of the expenses
involved in buying out going concerns, made nothing.

Harker was now in a position to engineer another class of enterprise
with entire safety. The firm was well-known, conservative, solid. Stock
of companies it organized was bought without question. Instead of
piking along he found he had in his hands swindles of great magnitude.
With the solid business they were doing an occasional failure cut no
figure.

The most important members of the office force—the heads of
departments as you might say—were all in the family. Harker’s family,
I mean—Pentecost had none. Alfred Harker—son of the senior partner,
twenty-two and a sharp one for his age—had charge of the office. Chief
clerk, I suppose you might call him. The head stenographer, Miss Mary
Finch Dugas, was a sister of Mrs. Harker, and the head accountant Mrs.
Harker’s nephew. As for the others, it didn’t matter. Nothing could
get by young Harker or Miss Dugas or the head accountant that there
was any reason for keeping in the shade. So the rest of the force had
been picked—like the furniture and decorations—to express innocence and
respectability—and they did it.

       *       *       *       *       *

When you realize that about two and a half years before this Mr.
Pentecost (under another name) had been practising law in Chicago—and
would most likely have been there still if he hadn’t been disbarred—and
that during the seven years he’d been at it he’d got to be one of the
most successful and sought-after defense attorneys they’d ever had out
there, you’ll have a pretty good basis to figure on him, especially
when I tell you the sort of business he drifted into and his amazing
methods of handling it.

When he came to be notable in certain ways among the legal
practitioners of Chicago, and inquiries began to be made as to who he
was and where he came from, nobody could give the answer. A rumor went
the rounds during the proceedings of his disbarment, that he’d formerly
been a confidence operator of some kind and had gone listening in at
the trial of one of his pals. It was said that something about the
legal maneuvers and court proceedings so impressed him with the idea
that a lawyer was a pretty slick thing to be, that he started right in
studying and reading and got by in a couple of years. I don’t know what
there is to that story, but it’s as good as any.

He was a solid, thick-set man of average height, with dark eyes that
bulged a little and occasionally went glassy—an odd trick you seldom
see. Made you think he’d gone off and left them for a moment while he
was attending to other matters. His eyelids a good part of the time
were at half mast, giving him a sleepy sort of look. It had a great
effect when, in a court proceeding, he suddenly came out of it with one
of his lightning strokes.

His face, smooth-shaven, was heavy and hardly ever expressed anything,
but he had expressions he could use when it suited his purpose.
His forehead slanted back quite noticeably—not retreating in any
sense—rather gave you the idea of the possibility of sudden and
relentless advance, like some beast that springs or strikes. All these
things didn’t make him appear anything especially remarkable. You see
lots of bullet-headed men about, also men whose eyes are prominent and
may go glassy for all you know. And drooping eyelids aren’t uncommon.

       *       *       *       *       *

I’ve been speaking of this man as Mr. Pentecost, but that wasn’t his
name at this time—in Chicago, I mean. On the door of his musty little
office in the North Western Building a bit of modest black lettering
announced the occupant as Max Spellman, Attorney at Law.

This Spellman (later Pentecost) had been plugging along in the law game
out there for something like two years before he attracted attention.
Then it began to be noticed in what is referred to as the underworld,
that a young attorney in the Ashland Block seemed to be having
extraordinary success in the cases of a number of small-caliber crooks
for whose defense he’d been engaged or appointed. The court named him
the first time, in a petty-larceny case where the accused was unable
to get counsel. It was the ingenuity of this fellow’s tactics that
first made him talked about, and a couple of instances of his lightning
quickness and audacity went the rounds of crookdom. This underworld
comment was hardly more than beginning when one of the high-up
operators—a super-crook you might say—who’d been rounded up after a six
months’ hunt—got Spellman to defend him, and from that time he was in
the middle of the map. The upper world now began to take notice, and
inquiries regarding the man flew about, but found nothing to light on.

More business than he could handle came in—and, with hardly an
exception, from below. Of course he didn’t get verdicts for his clients
every time, but his average was amazing. There was always a surprise in
some quick turn he’d make—some entirely unexpected stroke—the finding
of new and vital evidence and the throwing it at them just when it
would knock them silly. He’d get at them this way nearly every time,
and of course there was a rush to find a flaw, but there wasn’t a screw
or a bolt missing.

Don’t get the idea that he was in the least spectacular. Nothing of
the kind. No oratory nor impassioned pleading, nor any of those fancy
things you read about. He’d sit hunched up like a toad in court, solid
and motionless, never speaking unless necessary, and then in a voice
so low that spectators, if there were any, found it difficult to hear.
But—again like a toad—he struck with lightning quickness when the time
came.

To witnesses for the prosecution he was a scourge and a terror. His
gentle questioning, his weary manner and sleepily drooping eyelids,
nursed his victims into unguarded confidence, and then came the
lightning out of a clear sky, striking upon the least contradiction
or misstatement. His very appearance at such times—the backward slant
of his forehead, the sudden scorching fire of usually somnolent
eyes—confused and disconcerted.

When underworld business came in on him with a rush he began to be
careful about what cases he took—not as to the guilt or innocence of
the applicant, but in order to pick out what he had a sporting chance
to win. The possibilities of what extraordinary and ingenious defense
he could accomplish—sometimes not only approaching the danger line, but
frequently going a considerable distance on the other side of it—would
flash through his mind almost automatically as he made his first hasty
examination of the case; upon the character and attractiveness (for he
greatly enjoyed this phase of the game) of these possibilities would
depend his going into the defense.

       *       *       *       *       *

After Spellman really got going there wasn’t much of anything in
his line he wouldn’t do. All the tricks and political pulls were as
lower-case a-b-c to him, not to speak of the intimate personal records
of lawyers, judges, and police officials who were likely to come
within his sphere of action. Sphere doesn’t sound precisely right,
but you know what I mean. He had an extensive collection of the weak
spots—vulnerable regions, you might say—everywhere, and saw in an
instant how to play them in any given case. Through some sharp move or
threat in the right direction, or by dropping a bit of money where he
knew it would be picked up, or by whatever else he could use as a club,
he’d be about ninety per cent sure to get his man out of the mess.

One day, to give you an instance, the assistant cashier of a Chicago
bank of fairly decent standing was shown into Spellman’s office, and
told him, after some beating about, that he was shy in his accounts by
some two hundred and fifty thousand. The man, whose name was Chatfield,
gave out the well-known tale about playing the stock market.

“All gone?” Spellman inquired, without bothering to pull up his
drooping eyelids.

“Why—I think—not quite.”

“Damn _think_! You know to a nickel what you’ve got!”

“Yes—yes, sixteen thousand odd. I was—you see I was keeping it to—to
get away on.”

“They’ll be on to you soon, of course, or you wouldn’t be here.”

“There’s—there’s barely two days! My God! Barely two!” Chatfield
glanced about in a kind of agony. “And the—” (he swallowed with
difficulty) “—the examiner might get here sooner. We can never be sure!”

“You’ve got the remnant with you I see.”

Chatfield nodded and his eyes moved painfully about in a way that made
you think they’d fill up with tears in a minute.

“You want me to handle this affair I take it.”

“Oh, I _hoped_ you would. That’s what I——”

“Pass me the sixteen.”

The terrified cashier handed Spellman a large fat envelope, which the
latter opened in a weary sort of way, and having pulled the bunch of
bills out a little way, flicked their ends as he might a pack of cards
before the shuffle. Then he looked glassily at the assistant cashier
for a full minute.

“Can you steal another hundred thousand?” he finally asked.

“Why—why—I—you don’t mean——”

“Can you steal another hundred thousand?” with no change in inflection.

“Why—why, yes—I _could_—but you——”

“Take you long?”

“Long?—Oh yes! Well—quite a while. I should say several hours.”

“Two o’clock is several hours. Come here with it then.”

“Mr. Spellman, I can _do_ it!—Yes—I _can_ you know—but they—they’re
bound to find it out inside of twenty-four hours the way I—the way I’ve
got to get it this time!”

“I don’t care how you get it—I want it at two.”

Of course it didn’t happen as quick as that. I’m only giving you the
high spots.

When Chatfield came back at two with the money, Spellman put it in his
safe where the sixteen was already reposing. Then he phoned the bank
and got an appointment. Inside of half an hour he was seated in the
private office of the president, and was conveying to him alone (having
satisfied himself that no witnesses were within hearing distance) the
information that he had a client, Henry Parsons Chatfield by name, who
claimed to be the bank’s assistant cashier, and that—unless the man
was lying—they’d find his accounts a matter of three hundred and fifty
thousand short. He had strongly urged Mr. Chatfield, instead of trying
to escape with the hundred thousand or thereabout that he still had in
his possession after dumping the rest into Wall Street, to return it to
the bank and make a confession. This he found Chatfield willing to do
provided he could be safeguarded against arrest or legal action of any
description. He (Spellman) wasn’t presuming to advise the acceptance
of such a proposition. It seemed to be only a question of whether the
bank wished the money or preferred to prosecute—the latter in case
Chatfield could be apprehended.

Every time the bank president broke out on him—which of course he did
with all the force at his command—the lawyer cut him short.

“I must say, sir—this is a most extraordinary—a most _outrageous_——”

“Do you want it?”

“Are you aware, Mr. Spellman, of your own risk in——”

“Do you want it?”

“We shall certainly take steps to——”

“Do you want it?”

But of course Spellman knew they did—knew they’d have to have it—or he
wouldn’t have been there. Moreover, he noticed that the president made
no move to ring the bell and call in other officials of the bank. The
document he had ready was duly signed and executed. It wasn’t until
after that was done and the thing securely in his possession that he
paid over the hundred thousand to the bank. He returned six of the
sixteen in his safe to Chatfield, and with it a biting comment on the
assistant cashier’s consummate asininity. The remaining ten continued
to remain.

       *       *       *       *       *

For some time he played it this way, in and out of court, his adroit
defenses of various kinds attracting more and more attention; and those
who had begun to have symptoms of suspicion were very soon looking for
questionable work back of the records.

I’m going to tell you at once what I dare say you’ve suspected all
along, that Spellman was an amazingly successful manufacturer of
evidence. He couldn’t use it always, but when he did, the play was a
marvel. Everything came to that man in what is known as a flash. In the
matter of bogus evidence he not only saw instantly where it would come
in, but almost on the same ignition had the most elaborate defenses
figured out for it with every point protected.

No matter where those sharps and detectives who were after him dug in
and followed back the lines, they couldn’t find a thing to get hold of.
Witnesses had actually seen what they testified to—the circumstances
and surroundings and objects spoken of and dates and time of day given,
etc., stood every test.

Yet notwithstanding the outcome of these investigations, I have to tell
you that Mr. Spellman’s downfall resulted from a faulty piece of work
in one of his manufactured-evidence structures. He knew that it was
faulty and that they’d have it on him in the end, but the play did what
it was intended to do, which was to hold open a loophole for escape
just long enough so his client could dive through it. To save a comrade
who’d once saved him—that was what drove him to it. The outcome, which
he plainly saw, didn’t come within a thousand miles of making him
hesitate. What this man, whose name was Morrison, had done for him
or what he had saved him from, never came out; but it must have been
something worth while.

Morrison was in bad. If the case should come to trial he’d stand no
chance. Even Spellman couldn’t see any way out. His only hope lay in
quick action. I give you an idea of Spellman’s play in this case to
show you how it came about that he was eliminated from Chicago’s fetid
life, and, as Hugo J. Pentecost, turned loose upon a more or less
helpless world.

The quick action for the rescue of Bill Morrison from a more than
serious predicament involved the buying up of an obscure movie actor
named McArdle, doing small bits at the Essanay Studio on the North
Side, who looked enough like Morrison to be his twin. Pentecost had
used the movies in certain of his activities for a number of years,
having found that field of endeavor packed with evidence possibilities
that had never been worked; and in consequence he not only knew a
lot of people employed in it, but he had quite a few of his own men
scattered about in various studios. He remembered this McArdle on the
instant and must have paid him ten or twelve thousand to disappear
utterly for six weeks and turn over everything he owned, including his
name, clothing, diary, letters, photographs, accounts, contracts with
Essanay, and, in fact, everything there was, to him.

His game was possible because Morrison was a West Coast man and had
never operated in Chicago before, and McArdle had only recently come
over from London. If these things hadn’t happened to be the case,
Spellman would have taken some other track. But he instantly saw the
possibilities of this game if he rushed it and planted money lavishly
in a few necessary places.

The Essanay was an enormous concern in those days, frequently taking
fifteen or twenty pictures simultaneously, and naturally couldn’t keep
a close watch on their hundreds of small-part people—of whom McArdle
was one. Particularly was this so because these “artists” were hardly
ever seen at the studio except in make-up.

The crime for which Morrison was arrested—a murderous assault on one
of the clerks in a jewelry store—was committed in the early afternoon,
and he was picked up by the police that same evening. At the time of
the assault McArdle was engaged in his work in one of the Essanay
studios. Spellman got at him in his room in a cheap apartment building
between six and seven o’clock the next morning. It was, of course,
vital to the game that McArdle should not go to the studio again, and,
indeed, should be seen by no one who knew him. Those who had seen and
recognized him after the time of Morrison’s arrest must be taken care
of. If they couldn’t be, the game was off.

But the game wasn’t off on that account, for McArdle had been in his
rooms all the evening and no one had come there. He had dined at a
cheap restaurant near, but that was four hours before Morrison’s
arrest. Clear sailing so far. The money bargain was arranged after
Spellman had lifted the figure to the point where the temptation
wrestled successfully with McArdle’s fears.

As soon as Spellman had this nailed down he let Morrison know by a
prearranged signal—for he didn’t want to go near him just then—and
Morrison began to cut up in his cell and cry and beg to see some one,
as he wanted to confess. In the inspector’s office it transpired that
what he was so anxious to tell them was not that he was guilty, but
that when arrested the night before he’d been so terrified for fear his
employers in Chicago would hear of it that he’d given them a fictitious
name; but now he realized that he’d got to send word to the Essanay
studios that he couldn’t get there for his scene. You had to notify
them. If you didn’t they’d never give you another job. And would they
please send word for him to the Essanay? Couldn’t they say he’d been
in an automobile accident?—for if they knew up there that he was in
jail it would be the end of him.

He finally told them that his name was Walter McArdle, that he’d lately
come over from England, and that his occupation was acting for the
movies. He had no family and the only people he knew were the Essanay
managers who engaged him, and a few of the actors in the company—and
those not very well. Morrison was an artist and pushed it along the
line of one of his pet rôles. Everything tended to show that the man
was Walter McArdle. He later described without effort or hesitation
his lodgings on Rand Street and everything in them (I don’t need to
say that Spellman had been there first), where to find his accounts,
letters from home, how many shirts he had, and so forth and so on.

He told them, in answer to questions, all about the picture he’d been
working in; you see Spellman had got everything possible out of McArdle
before he left. But his crook artistry led to his instructing Morrison
to make a slip or two in places where a person with an ordinary memory
might not have been quite sure. Remembering too much is often more
dangerous than remembering too little.

McArdle, except in rare instances, was seen at the studio in North
Chicago only with his make-up on, and in these rare instances it would
be only for brief moments as he passed in or out of the building on his
way to and from his dressing room. As a consequence those associated
with him in the picture—directors, photographers, electricians,
property men, and his fellow actors in the cast—were misled by
Morrison’s close resemblance, and testified to his being McArdle, and
that he was at the studio occupied with his work in the picture on the
afternoon the robbery and assault was committed. His entire familiarity
with the piece they’d been filming and incidents that happened during
its progress—some, indeed, on the very afternoon of the arrest—had
great weight in the Essanay offices.

There were three persons whose evidence cost money, owing to the fact
that they knew McArdle too well for Morrison to get by: the manager
of the cheap restaurant where the movie actor got his meals; the girl
waitress at the same place; and the actor who dressed in the same
room with him at the Essanay studios. Particularly the last. He was
a bit “fly” and saw that he had them. Also he wanted his in advance.
This mass of evidence, with much more—such as that of the janitor of
the building where McArdle roomed and many minor things that had been
attended to—accomplished its purpose. No doubt existed that the police
had arrested the wrong man. The police themselves were convinced of it.
And the necessary formalities for his release having been gone through,
Bill Morrison made his getaway.

Not many days later Max Spellman did the same.

The collapse of the jerry-built structure that Spellman had hastily
thrown together for a rush showing, with its apparently overwhelming
evidence of mistaken identity, was deferred several days longer than
he expected. He waited on the one-in-a-thousand chance that it might,
after all, escape destruction. But on the third day after Morrison
had gone, a strange car with a disguised Spellman in it disappeared
north of the Lake Boulevard, and Chicago saw him (as Spellman) no
more. The first weak point to give way was the flapper waitress, who
found it impossible to keep her mouth shut about the money she’d been
paid to do that very thing. That started the crash. Proceedings for
Spellman’s disbarment swiftly followed. In addition it began to be said
about that he was “wanted.” But wanting was a matter of some distance
from getting. How could it be otherwise when Spellman had ceased to
exist? It was a plain case of transmigration of souls. The spirit that
had tenanted the body of Max Spellman now moved into that of Hugo
Pentecost—quite another proposition; and not differing alone because of
a dark and well-trimmed beard, giving him something the appearance of
a prosperous and experienced physician, but owing as well to a number
of other changes in form, shape, expression, and more or less minor
characteristics.

This metamorphosis, however, took time, and for months nothing was
known of the man undergoing it. Then something peculiar began to dawn
on the Crooks’ and Malefactors’ Guild. (You may as well call it that as
anything.) Two or three large operations engineered by some of the Big
Ones were mysteriously “tapped”—which is to say, the operators found
themselves caught in a situation where they had to give up a share or
quit—otherwise it was the cooler. It wasn’t a great while before word
passed along that a peg was playing them from the dark side. Whoever
this super crook might be, he continued to stay in the gloom. When he
got the hook in his victim, his agent called, and it was pay or get it
in the neck. And as this came to be played on them more and more they
began putting a name to him—“The Vulture.”

It’s hardly necessary to call your attention to the fact that the
recently arrived Mr. Pentecost had a most extraordinary equipment
for the prosecution of such undertakings. Fully acquainted, even
before he took up the practice of law in Chicago, with every phase of
criminality, and familiar with the methods and characteristics of those
engaged in it, his Spellman career brought to his hand all the weapons
of sharp practice and chicanery that the crafty and hazardous defense
of his underworld clients compelled him to use.

       *       *       *       *       *

More than two years after Mr. Spellman’s disappearance, Mr. Stephen
Harker (not operating under that name at the time) became suddenly
aware that the talons of the offensive bird recently spoken of had sunk
themselves into him. But a remarkable thing occurred. “The Vulture”
wanted to see him. A meeting was arranged by an agent. Pentecost had a
few tried and tested assistants in his business whom he liked to refer
to as “trusties,” and this man was one of them. A year later he had
fifteen or twenty mostly planted in the large cities throughout the
country. These men were occupied solely in assisting him about his own
operations—he had no idea of getting control of others and becoming a
big boss of criminality like those you read about. Nobody ever did that
anyway.

At the time he saw Harker he was beginning to have schemes for some
of the most daring operations that had ever been conceived, and he’d
got the idea that it would be a great advantage to work from the sound
basis of a partnership and an office and a high-class rating.

The thing was brought about, resulting in the firm of Harker &
Pentecost, with a perfectly satisfactory standing in the business
world. Harker was the senior partner, but Pentecost was the power
plant, and as soon as Harker got a gleam of the extraordinary sort of
person it was who’d picked him up, he didn’t want it any other way. The
running of the promoting schemes was left in his hands, while Pentecost
conducted operations that were sufficiently dangerous and unusual to
interest him. These affairs took him to all parts of the country, and
he quite frequently spotted something in the way of a novelty that was
more or less in Harker’s department. He couldn’t so much as glance at
a thing without having a complete and, more often than not, amazingly
ingenious method of operating it flash automatically through his mind.

They pegged along with a sort of team work for some time, Pentecost
running to operations with a higher and higher percentage of danger
to them, and Harker running to a higher and higher degree of anxiety
on account of same, for owing to the partnership, he was in on them
too. Once in a while he’d try to hook Pentecost back from something,
but he never succeeded, and as one after another of these close-call
enterprises got by—always, it turned out, protected by the most
remarkable system of defensive lay-outs ever seen—he quit talking
about it. That big risk and protection game appeared to be Pentecost’s
delight. Often it would seem that he purposely played it as close as
he could just to see them come up against his extraordinarily laid-out
safety systems.

       *       *       *       *       *

He was over in Boston one summer (it was the third year of the
partnership), and had been there some five or six weeks attending to a
little affair he had going in that town. Rather an ancient game it was,
but he’d taken advantage of conditions to rejuvenate it. “Fifty percent
in forty-five days and pull out whenever you like,” was the captivating
slogan set in circulation. All the boobs ask for is a new excuse. If
they can’t understand it, all the better—so long as it has the sound
of money. Pentecost had one for them right fresh off the bat of the
World War. “International Postal Reply Coupons” was his, and it did
the trick. After the prompt payment of the forty-five days’ interest
two or three times, there was a rush. People blocked the corridors
of the office building where the headquarters of this hoary but
brought-up-to-date swindle were situated, and fought for places in the
line so they could get the chance to pitch away their money. Over nine
million five hundred thousand was shaken out of socks and drawn out of
savings banks and pushed over to Pentecost—or rather to the dummy he’d
put in as manager, for of course he never appeared in it himself. This
dummy was an innocent, simple-minded Italian, or Italian-American, dug
up by one of Pentecost’s men and buzzed by two or three of them till
he really came to believe this “Postal Reply” business was a gorgeous
and legitimate undertaking. So enthusiastic about it did he become
that he set to work with something bordering on religious frenzy;
and so completely did his favorable opinion of the enterprise take
possession of him that when, some time later, the warning signal went
up and Pentecost notified him—through his trusties—to quit at once
and he’d find a high-powered car waiting for him at a certain place,
the fellow refused to budge. He was perfectly sure the Postal Reply
Coupons affair was a profitable and reputable undertaking, and if the
owners, whoever they were, were going to give it up, he’d go on with
it himself. He had clerks there who knew the way to run it. It was in
vain the two men who had charge of him—the same two who’d been making
a nightly clean-up of the day’s receipts, transferring the amounts to
various banks in the distant cities—argued with him.

When Pentecost heard of the Italian’s crazy ideas he made every
possible effort to get him away. The simplicity and innocence of the
poor devil hit him in the one spot where he was soft. But in this
affair the time was too short. The police pounced on the Italian before
Pentecost’s men could kidnap him, as they had orders to do.

The Sunday following, in his rooms at one of the hotels, Mr. Pentecost
had a stack of the morning papers and was lazily running through the
sensational accounts of the collapse of the Postal Reply Swindle, with
their graphic descriptions of the arrest of the Italian supposed to
have been at the head of it—of his wild insistence that everything was
all right—of the frantic mob of investors fighting and screaming for
their money—together with the statements and opinions of inspectors,
district attorneys, financiers, Post Office authorities and what not,
on the various aspects of the colossal fraud. It was a most amusing
mess—one he’d have enjoyed immensely if his crazy Italian hadn’t got
the hooks in him. He was sore as the devil about that.

As he carelessly turned the pages in other parts of one of the huge
Sunday editions, his eye was suddenly caught and held by the heading of
a full-page write-up in one of them, which read:

  HERMIT INVENTOR OF WEST ROXBURY

  MECHANICAL GENIUS SOLE OCCUPANT OF OLD CRIPPS MANSION

  MARVELOUS MACHINES BUT NO SALES

Pentecost had been lolling about in bathrobe and slippers, but now he
sat erect and read on rapidly. The article strongly reinforced the
notion he’d got from the headlines that he might find something out
there that would come in nicely for Harker. His plan had been to leave
for New York on the “Merchants’ Limited” (that is, the Sunday train
running at that time on the “Merchants’” schedule), but he decided to
take one of the night expresses instead, so he could get out to Roxbury
and see what the fellow had.

The article spoke of the mansion as being on Torrington Road, but gave
no further indication of its locality, and even at so early a stage
of a barely possible chance, Pentecost would no more have thought of
making enquiries than of swallowing rat poison. There were two or
three pictures of the house, and several of the mechanical genius
himself, which might help some. He took a taxi, dismounting as soon
as they reached Torrington Road. After paying the fare and observing
that the vehicle had safely disappeared townward with no questionable
hesitation, he walked up the road. It was late in the afternoon and
warm—the date being precisely mid August.

Mr. Pentecost, as he thought he could, recognized the old Cripps
mansion from the newspaper illustrations. As he walked up the
weed-grown and rutted driveway there was nothing he failed to take in:
the ruinous gateway at the entrance with its great square posts—once
painted white, but now a streaked and dirty brown, and one of them
considerably off plumb; the neglected lawns with their tangles of
overgrown grass and weeds and ancient misguided shrubbery that had long
since heeded the call of the wild; the old elm trees clustered about
the house and densely shading it; and the mansion itself, much needing
paint and repair, particularly as to the huge wooden columns supporting
the roof of a front portico two stories in height.

He saw, too, that the walls of the house were covered with a heavy
growth of Virginia creeper and that this vigorous vine was massed
thickly about most of the windows. Another thing he noticed was that
several panes of glass were broken out of the second-story window on
the left under the portico roof, and that the opening had been boarded
up on the inside.

He noted all these things without pause while approaching the house,
which was set at some distance back from the road; and after mounting
the wide stone steps of the portico and crossing it, he pressed the
push button at the right of the door. After waiting a little he gave
it a more forceful shove. Still getting no response, he was in the act
of raising his hand to the large and rusty knocker when the door was
quietly opened and a rather tall and exceedingly slender young man
stood before him in the dimness of the hall.




PART III


Most people who knew the house supposed that Michael Sutherland Cripps
was the builder as well as the owner and occupant of the Cripps
Mansion, as it was called, in the district of Boston popularly referred
to as West Roxbury, though in reality situated in the southwestern
extension of Jamaica Plain. But most people were mistaken.

Mr. Cripps had, about middle life, made a pretty good “deal”—for those
days—when he suddenly got on to the way things were going in the
suburbs and made a few choice investments. As a result, he became what
was then called a millionaire. Of course he’d have been a mere piker
now, but as he couldn’t read the future, he was well satisfied. At last
he could do something. And the first thing was to get some sort of a
family about him.

You see, this Cripps was naturally a lonely man—actually suffered
unless he had people in the house with him; and he hadn’t had anybody
since the death of his parents some years before.

What I’ve said shows you that he had no family of his own—wife and all
that. He wasn’t at all a woman hater, but he was a merciless woman
critic. Odd thing, too, for he liked them first off, but every time he
got within striking distance of matrimony he saw what a tiresome thing
it was likely to be, and thereupon fled for his life.

All the same, his ideal was to live in the midst of a family,—to have
about him those who would be company for him and yet not have “claims”
and things like that, that would make life a wretched bore.

Now that he’d made his haul, his first thought was to advertise for
a family to come and live with him. But really nice people wouldn’t
answer such an ad, and that was the only kind he wanted. Along here the
thought of his own relatives occurred to him. That wasn’t a bad idea.
He’d get some of them to come.

His only near relative was a widowed sister, Cynthia Findlay, living
with her two children in St. Louis. Mr. Cripps had been supporting
them for a number of years, both before and after her husband—a poor,
disreputable fish—died of drink. She inherited nothing of value from
Mr. Findlay except his absence, which was priceless but couldn’t be
turned into money. She wouldn’t have parted with it, anyway.

He’d always liked Cynthia, and she’d had a tough life of it. He’d
have her as a starter for his adopted-family enterprise. Yes, and the
children would come in nicely, too. He’d always heard that children
kept things lively. Well, that was the way he wanted them.

He had quite a lot of kin in the cousin line—mostly seconds. A male one
consented to accept his invitation—for a time at least, and brought
with him a sprightly wife and two quite charming grown-up daughters.

Then there were two elderly ladies who might be called cousins-in-law,
one being the widow of a distant cousin and the other her sister. He
was delighted that they would come, for they were witty and cheerful
and level-headed.

And there were several youngish chaps in the remote distances
of relationship. Cripps succeeded in getting two of them—one a
second-rate sort of thing, the other a decent young fellow who was
temporarily out of a job and was persuaded to try to find one in Boston.

That seemed to be about the limit of what he wanted. The only children
he drew were his sister’s two youngsters, Dorothy and Augustus, nine
and five years old, respectively.

After Mr. Cripps made sure he could get a decent lot to come and be a
family to him, he looked about for a satisfactory place in which to
establish it—and found it. One of the finest old places of the time
it was, out Roxbury way on Torrington Road, and he picked it up at an
extraordinary bargain.

He had the house done over in various ways and everything up to date,
said date being back in the Nineties, but they had a few things even
in that benighted decade. Gas, electricity, telephones, half a dozen
bathrooms, a hot water heating system, and a few little things like
that, did him very well. For a couple of years or so he had to manage
as best he could with horses—but after that motor cars came in. Movies,
aeroplanes and radio he had to struggle along without. But not knowing
about them made the deprivation less severe.

Michael Cripps was a good spender and was bound to have the best
of everything. A delightful host he was, too, reveling in the
consciousness that he was taking care of people—giving them a good
time. Besides his adopted family, he’d go out of his way to track down
some unfortunate boyhood friend, or some far distant relative who
hadn’t done well, and give him the time of his life.

So there he was, no longer suffering the—to him—hideous nightmare of
having to live alone in a desolate house, but situated in a luxurious
mansion, virtually in the country, yet only a few miles from the
violently beating heart of the town, and surrounded by his own people,
who turned out to be very enjoyable company—some of them, indeed, quite
charming.

All went well and pleasantly—if you leave out occasional minor discords
of small consequence—for quite some years. But owing to the inroads of
death, marriage, and desertion, the population of the mansion decreased
as time went on, and no way to recruit it to full strength occurred to
Mr. Cripps. His sister Cynthia died early in 1904 and was followed by
her daughter Dorothy a year and a half later. Others of the household
had crossed the line; then, too, a couple of marriages had snatched
their victims from the fold; and a few of the members of this synthetic
family had departed for reasons of their own.

It had been quite a successful experiment as experiments go—more so
than you’d think; and there’s no denying that old Cripps had got a lot
of satisfaction out of it. But the thing had been falling away from him
piece by piece, and finally his sister’s son Augustus was the only one
left in the house with him. The old man had had a good pull at it, but
here he was down to the last dreg—as you’d be likely to call it if you
were acquainted with that precious nephew of his.

Being the only near relative that old Mr. Cripps now had on hand—or,
indeed, had at all—it was generally supposed that Augustus Findlay
would inherit the mansion, together with whatever else the old
gentleman should die possessed of. But all did not go well between
the two and there were times when gossip had it that the sporty young
nephew would lose out on the “give and bequeath” proposition if he
didn’t shove down the emergency brake on his behavior.

It was surely a trying thing for Michael Sutherland Cripps, with age
and rheumatism already beginning to frolic with him, and the most of
his once big pile melted away—or more truthfully pelted away, for
during these years of his family life he’d spent without limit—to have
to associate on intimate terms with a most objectionable brat of a
nephew, coming in nearly every night of his life fuddled with booze—a
cheap skate, and an unmitigated loafer in the real sense of the word,
for at the age of twenty-six never a thought of earning his living
had crossed his mind. Yet with all that he wasn’t a bad looker—almost
handsome in a dissipated sort of way. And he could be charming on
occasion. Women appeared fascinated by him—that is, some women. He had
a high-class one on the line once and came near landing her, but she
found out in time, tore out the hook, and swam away.

People wondered that old Cripps, whose violent temper was known
throughout the West Roxbury and Jamaica Plains districts, was standing
for that sort of thing in the house with him day after day—night after
night. But the poor old boy had a reason for standing it—his absolute
terror of being left alone. Whatever else the presence of Augustus did
to him it saved him from that.

       *       *       *       *       *

One afternoon late in October (it was 1910 by this time) Mr. Cripps
was in the attic of the mansion trying to find something, when his
glance happened to light on an old trunk in which he’d been accustomed
to put letters from people acknowledging his delightful hospitality—a
lazy way of keeping a visitors’ book. Up to now he’d only once had
occasion to refer to these letters, and then merely to get an address.
So long as the Present held out as an agreeable institution, Cripps
didn’t care a great deal about recollections of bygone episodes. But
of late the Present hadn’t been doing so well by him, and the Past was
beginning to exhibit symptoms of attractiveness. One of these symptoms
now manifested itself, drawing him so gently that he could hardly feel
its pull, toward the old trunk of letters. He found a crippled chair
in which he sat down before the thing and managed—with some little
difficulty—to raise the lid.

He’d been there nearly an hour, glancing at letters which he picked up
at random here and there, when he came upon a little package of three
tied together and addressed in a hand he’d forgotten. But when he began
to read one of them he remembered. It was from a young girl who’d been
visiting there.

More than eighteen years ago the first of the letters was written.
Pretty handwriting it was. Now he came to think of it, he’d always
liked her handwriting, whoever she was. Glancing at the end, he found
that she had signed herself Iris. Oh yes, now he began to remember!
Quite a—yes—quite a charming little thing she was, too! By Jove yes!
And he’d come very near to—to——His thoughts whirled a little here,
but they settled down again in a moment. What was all this—he hadn’t
married her, so why bother about it? He couldn’t quite recall how
she came to be visiting there. Oh yes, now he remembered! She was a
distant relative—almost indescribably distant. One of those things like
second cousin of your brother-in-law’s first wife. And that reminded
him that he used to call her his cousin a thousand times removed!
It had been quite a joke between them; and at one time he had come
breathlessly near to wiping out the entire bunch of removals by making
one little suggestion—which, however, he never made. No, he never
made it, worse luck! Or was it worse? A sweet little thing she was,
and her name was—her name——He’d forgotten it again and glanced at the
end of the letter. Oh, Iris—yes, of course! Iris Heminway. He got her
last name himself. His dear little cousin, a thousand times removed.
He couldn’t think what ever became of her! Nothing in the letter but
what a perfectly lovely visit she’d had. Perhaps the next one might
have something. Postmark made it four weeks later—no, five. He began
to read. That was it—just what he thought! Somebody has asked her to
marry him and she doesn’t know what to do. Wants to know what he thinks
of her marrying a machinist. Machinist! He couldn’t recall what he’d
answered. Most likely he’d told her to go on and marry the entire
machine shop if she felt drawn to it! By George—now he thought of it,
he did say just that! Rotten beastly pride! Huffed that she’d spoken of
some one else—and there she was giving him the chance, even though he’d
never written to her in all that time! Probably doesn’t give the chap’s
name. Yes—there it was—Haworth! (Reading to himself from the letter):
“His name is Charlie Haworth. He’s a special kind of a machinist and
draughtsman and his home is in Montreal. I’m sure he is a splendid
fellow, but I thought I would like to ask your advice about it.”

That was all. She didn’t say when or where, but just wanted his advice.
Well, he’d given it to her!

And here was the last letter—Canada stamp and Montreal postmark. Yes,
she’d married the machinist and gone up there. Two years later the
letter was, according to the postmark.—Oh! Baby! That was it! (Reading
again to himself): “... wanted you to know, so I’m writing you the
first one. Of course we want his name to be from his father—Charles—but
I thought you wouldn’t mind if we called his middle name after you, so
it will be Charles Michael Haworth.”

The old man sat there for quite a while, staring before him. Then,
rather suddenly, the thought came to him that he might be able to find
these people, especially that boy—though of course he wouldn’t be a boy
any longer. He’d be along seventeen or eighteen, he should think. He
looked at the letter again. Montreal, and she gave the street address;
but that was years ago. He might try it though, just to see. Charles
Michael Haworth. He rather liked the name.

That evening he wrote a letter to the address given and sent it out to
the nearest mailbox.

But in the night he got to thinking the thing over so intensely that
sleep was impossible. It came to him then that the letter business was
a waste of time. He got nervous, too, about the matter of death, the
thought of which seldom bothered him. And on top of everything his
dissolute nephew came lurching into the house about four-thirty in the
morning, banging the heavy front door after him so that the building
shuddered, careening against furniture, and finally stumbling up the
stairway, all the while emitting a stream of disconnected profanity.

This was the finishing touch for old man Cripps. He rolled himself
out of bed and made one bull rush—in his nightgown and bare feet—into
the upper hall, meeting the astonished inebriate near the head of
the stairs. Seizing him by the collar with both hands, he shook him
back and forth, then dragged him bumping and rolling down the stairs,
through the great entrance hall, out of the front door, across the
entrance portico, and from there heaved him sprawling into the roadway.

For one instant the enraged old man stood looking at the dark mass
lying there at the bottom of the steps, then turning with a sudden
start he charged back into the house and up the stairs again and
through the upper hall to his nephew’s bedroom, where he seized with
frenzied clutchings all the clothing he could find in drawers, closets,
on chairs, and on the floor, which he forthwith pitched out through the
doorway into the hall, prancing back and forth across the room a dozen
times or more to do it.

Where the old gentleman got his wind for all this would be a
serious problem in physics and chemistry, for he was heavily built,
underexercised, and with a tobacco heart. Anyway, he did it.

As soon as he’d cleared out everything he could find he rushed out and
down the hall to his own room, and shoved in every bell push in the
place, and kept on shoving until the chauffeur came running up the
stairs, followed by both maids and the cook, and shortly after by the
head gardener and his ten-year-old son from their cottage near. All
were clutching together such garments as they’d hastily snatched up and
thrown on over their night clothes.

Mr. Cripps had a fad for bells from his room to everyone concerned. But
it was the chauffeur he wanted this time, and he yelled to him to get
the car (it was 1910 by now, and of course he had one) and take the
blankety-blank carcass of putrid hogwash at the bottom of the front
steps an’ dump it in the road—anywhere—any street—any road! Just get
the blankety-blank-blank-blank out of this place and his clothes with
him—that was all he asked!

“Here, you!” he shouted in a general way to the maids and cook, “pitch
those clothes out on top of him where Henry can find ’em—that pile in
front of his door! Take ’em all—every damn stitch—you understand? Throw
out everything he’s got! Don’t leave a damn thing he ever touched!” (To
the chauffeur) “And when you’ve dumped the dirty loafer, and his putrid
stuff on top of him, a couple of miles down the road, you come back
and take me to town! North Station is what I want! I’ll be gone two or
three days, and if any of you people allow that dirty, foul-mouthed,
booze-soaked bum to crawl back into this house while I’m away I’ll fire
the lot of you—take that from me!”

As in many instances, I can give you, in this one, only an approximate
idea of the language used. I had the testimony of four persons who were
witnesses of the scene, and the only danger is that it lacks the proper
amount of intensity and force. If it isn’t clear what happened, just
take it that Augustus Findlay was thoroughly and effectually kicked out
of the house.

The servants, without exception, liked old man Cripps. You could almost
say they were fond of him. Their opinion of Augustus I needn’t mention;
so there wasn’t the slightest danger that he’d get into the house again
even if they had to take turn and turn about in night watches to make
sure of it.

The maids attended to the throwing out of the clothes with a spirit
that could only have been born of the great enjoyment they took in
the work, and the chauffeur did no less when it came to his part of
the job. After which he transported the old gentleman to the North
Station, getting him there in time for the morning train to Montreal.

       *       *       *       *       *

Those three faded letters from Iris Heminway sent old Mr. Cripps
to Canada in the hope of finding her and her husband and boy, and
persuading them to come and live with him. But after an hour on the
train he began to realize what an extremely off chance he had of
succeeding in his quest, with the meager amount of information in his
possession. They might have moved to another town—they might even be
dead. Many things can happen in eighteen years. But now he’d started,
he was going on with it! Well, he should think so!

The following morning he began the search, and had no difficulty in
finding the address. It was a modest frame cottage beginning to show
its age. A large middle-aged woman came to the door, and when Mr.
Cripps explained that he was trying to trace a family named Haworth
which had once occupied the house, she said at once, “Oh, I can tell
you that,” and asked him in.

In the little front room she said: “Charlie lives here with me. Was it
’im you was askin’ about?”

He was so dumfounded at coming upon the object of his search at the
very start that his “yes” was hardly audible. Then he added, “And—and
Mrs. Haworth and the boy?”

“It’s the boy as is ’ere, sir; there ain’t none of ’em left but ’im.”

They sat down in the small room.

“You don’t—you don’t mean both of his parents are dead!”

“Yes, sir! ’Is mother she died about three years ago, an’ ’is father
quite a spell before that.”

“And the little boy’s been living here with you since?”

“Yes, sir, ’e ’as. But you’d ’ardly call ’im _little_, sir; ’e’s comin’
on to eighteen.”

“Yes yes—of course. I knew he must be grown up, but in spite of that I
couldn’t help thinking of him as a youngster. Is he—is he a nice boy?
All right and—and straight—and good habits?”

“Indeed ’e is—a dear boy—but ’e’s a bit strange; an’ I ’opes, sir, if
you ’ave any influence with ’im, you’ll try if you can’t do something
about it.”

“Influence! But my God! I’ve never seen him, Mrs.——”

“Towse, sir.”

“Well, you see, Mrs. Towse, I don’t know the boy at all, and what’s
more I doubt if he ever heard of me. So what I might say would hardly
count with him, would it?”

“Of course,” Mrs. Towse said, “if you don’t know ’im you couldn’t do
anything just yet, but after you get acquainted ’e might listen to you.”

“What seems to be the matter?” Mr. Cripps inquired. The devastating
fear had come upon him that it might be another case of Augustus.

“It’s the way ’e was born, I suppose. ’E’s got so many ideas of ’is own
that ’e can’t go along satisfactory with w’at you might call reg’lar
work. W’y, ’e’d be a first-class machinist drawin’ good pay, but ’e’s
so full o’ plans an’ ideas for this an’ that, ’e don’t seem to keep ’is
mind on anything they put ’im to.”

Mr. Cripps inquired if the young man was doing anything just now.

“Mercy on us! Why, we can’t ’ardly get ’im ’ome for ’is meals, ’e’s
that taken up with ’is invention work; but the thing ’e gets to workin’
on don’t never seem to be w’at people want.”

“What kind of things are they?”

“W’y, there’s all sorts. ’E gets an idea an’ then nothin’ can stop
’im—no matter w’ether it’s somethin’ worth botherin’ with or not. Some
o’ the best men in Smith an’ Gaynor’s—that’s w’ere his father use to
work—they say ’e’s got a wonderful invention faculty an’ Mr. Gaynor
’imself said it just after ’e’d been lookin’ over a clock Charlie made.
It took ’im nigh to a year to finish it. Mr. Gaynor said the boy ’ad
some kind o’ new an’ un’eard-of escapin’ thing I b’lieve they called
it, that no one had ever seen or thought of before.”

“Wouldn’t it sell?”

“Not at first it wouldn’t, but w’en ’e’d ’most given it up a Mr.
Patterson ’appened to come along an’ offered ’im two ’undred dollars
for it an’ a patent on the new escapin’ thing, an’ Charlie took it.
That might sound good enough for a clock, but it ain’t no pay w’en
you comes to consider eleven months’ work, not to speak of what ’e’d
’ad to buy to make it of. But mercy! I didn’t ’ave any expectation it
would sell! I don’t see what anyone in their senses would want of such
a thing around the house, tickin’ that powerful you could hear it ’alf
a block, an’ strikin’ different sorts o’ bells an’ chimes, an’ cuckoos
singin’, an’ sun an’ moon risin’ an’ settin’, an’ ships rockin’, an’
folks comin’ in an’ out with umbrellas, an’ all. I don’t see how
people can get any sleep with all them things goin’ on!”

“Where is he, Mrs. Towse? Not here. I suppose?”

“W’y, just now ’e’s workin’ over to Rawlingson’s Garage on Westover
Street. They took ’im in there to help on repair work, an’ as soon as
’e gets to dreamin’ they dock ’is time. You see, it was the on’y way
to manage. But o’ course in a big place like Smith an’ Gaynor’s they
couldn’t trouble with no such things.”

Mr. Cripps learned that the elder Haworth had succumbed to an attack of
pneumonia some five years previously, and that his fragile little wife
had outlived him only a year and a half. The Smith & Gaynor people,
where the elder Haworth had been employed so long, were more than
generous, supporting Mrs. Haworth and the boy as long as she lived,
and after her death doing everything possible to give young Charlie a
good start as a machinist, which seemed to be the only line of work he
wanted to undertake. They apprenticed him through their shops, finding
that he was the master of every machine in the place—as well as the
drafting room and foundry—in an incredibly short time. But when it came
to regular employment, nothing could be done with him. His inability
to hold his mind to the work in hand after it had been swept by one of
his inventive brain storms was absolute. After many efforts to overcome
this difficulty they finally had to give it up and let the young man go.

Following that he picked up stray jobs here and there, handing over
whatever he earned to Mrs. Towse, who mothered him along, even buying
his clothing for him when she judged that it was necessary.

Mrs. Towse had gone to the garage to get him, and the old gentleman
waiting in the small front room felt his heart pounding most
unusually—he couldn’t imagine why. He’d never set eyes on the boy. How
could he be so disturbed over the question of the kind of boy he’d
prove to be? At last Mrs. Towse, breathing hard, came briskly into
the room, followed by a boyish-looking young man with a pale face and
steady brown eyes.

“’Ere ’e is, sir! This is Charlie Haworth!”

The two shook hands, Haworth with his serious, steady gaze on the older
man.

“Come now, Mrs. Towse” (from Mr. Cripps, smiling), “you didn’t give him
his full name. You may not know it, Mr. Haworth, but your middle name
is Michael and you owe it, in a certain sense, to me.”

The young fellow nodded slightly without taking his eyes off Mr.
Cripps. He was a trifle above medium height and rather slim, with
a delicate sort of face smooth shaven. His hair was dark but not
black. He wore “jumpers” over his regular clothes, and his hands,
notwithstanding that Mrs. Towse had made him wash them, were soiled
with what would not come off. The most noticeable thing about him was
a sort of innocent childlikeness in the steady, serious gaze of his
luminous brown eyes. When they were turned toward a person who spoke
or was spoken of, they rested on him for some little time, giving the
impression, not of staring, but of calmly reflecting on what he saw or
what the person was or had been saying.

They talked a little, Haworth answering with quiet and simple
directness when asked about his work and what, in the way of
inventions, was particularly interesting him at the present moment.

It proved to be what is known as a “time stamp”—a device for printing
the exact hour and minute of the day on workmen’s cards as they passed
in and out of factories, or on letters and such things in offices and
hotels. These machines must carry a movable printing mechanism that is
controlled by clockwork.

“Is that a new idea?” Cripps asked.

“No. I’m making one on a new principle, that’s all.”

“I see—new principle. And it’ll be a better one than the old, of
course?”

“Well, I’ll like it better, anyway,” Haworth answered, with a shadowy
smile, the first Mr. Cripps had seen on his serious face, and he was
struck by the way it lighted it up for the brief time it was there. A
moment of silence followed. Then Haworth, serious again, asked in a low
voice, “Is your name Michael?”

“Yes—Michael Cripps.”

“My mother told me. She spoke of you once in a while.”

Mr. Cripps was silent a moment, quite moved.

“I was looking over some letters,” he soon resumed, “and came across
the one she wrote telling me she’d given you the Michael out of my
name, and it—well, I had a sudden feeling that I—that I’d very much
like to see you—and—and her too if such a thing had been possible.”

Another silence, then, “Did you bring the letter?” Haworth asked.

“Why, yes. I’ve got it over at the hotel.” He read the eagerness in
the young man’s eyes and went on: “Perhaps you’ll drop in there this
evening. There’s that letter and two others. Do come. I’d like to have
a little chat.”

After a few seconds, while his steady calm eyes rested on the old man,
Haworth spoke.

“I will,” he said.

“Good,” said Mr. Cripps. And not long after—for he knew the value of
brevity in such a case, he shook hands with both of them and told
Haworth where he was staying. He went on foot the entire distance to
the hotel, vastly enjoying a shadowy revisitation of the feeling known
as treading on air.

The old fellow was captivated with the young one. So much so that
a painful dread took possession of him that he might not be able
to persuade him to leave Montreal, which was his home, and where,
undoubtedly, all the friends he had were living. Young Haworth, he was
certain, knew little about money and cared for it even less; for which
reason no pecuniary advantages he (Cripps) could hold out would be
likely to attract him.

It was Mr. Ralph Gaynor of the Smith & Gaynor Machine Works, who gave
Mr. Cripps the most light on Haworth’s characteristics as to pecuniary
matters, his genius for invention, and his inability to do steady work.
This Mr. Gaynor, who was head of the works, thought young Haworth was
hopeless. He could _learn_ all right. Good God! The boy was a marvel
when it came to that! He’d know more about a machine inside of two days
than a man they’d had on it for years. But when it came to steady work
he just couldn’t do it. Not but what he tried his best, but his mind
would get off on something else and you can’t leave big lathes and
complicated drill presses with anybody like that.

“O’ course I lit into him and gave it to him right from the shoulder,”
Mr. Gaynor said, “but it didn’t do any good. Then I fired him, and
he’d sure have starved if that Towse woman hadn’t gone on feeding him
for nothing—which she couldn’t afford to do. Then we took him back an’
tried him with a helper to watch him, but even that wouldn’t work when
he got one of his real inventing fits on him. So we had to give him up.
Fond of the boy too, but there’s a limit.”

“What do you think of his talent—his inventive faculty?”

“Well, I’ll tell you. There isn’t any doubt but what he’s got a lot
in him for new mechanical methods, but he can’t get anywhere with it
because he hasn’t got the faintest conception of what people want. And
telling him’s no good. You might as well tell a rooster to lay eggs. Of
course he might hit on a winner by accident. That happens with these
dreamy chaps once in a while, but the big guns like Edison, Marconi,
and that lot know what they’re about every minute, an’ what’s more they
never forget it. Now you must excuse me. There’s a new man on that
third lathe down there I’ve got to keep an eye on. Glad to see you.
Welcome to look through the shop if you care for such things. Good
day.” And Mr. Gaynor hurried out of his office.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mr. Cripps ran a carefully managed campaign to bring about the capture,
as you might put it, of Charles Michael Haworth, and he ran it well;
for there’s no denying that he was a man of judgment. And at once
appreciating the serious limitations on what would attract the young
man, he came down without delay to pushing one thing—the advantage of
having a shop of his own, with whatever machines and room he required.

He played up to this with extreme caution, not speaking of it at all
when Haworth called upon him that first evening, and only hinting at
such a possibility during their next interview the day after. The third
time they met, which was at the garage where Haworth was employed, he
expressed curiosity as to whether young Haworth would care for a place
where he could experiment and do what he pleased.

It appeared that young Haworth would; and soon thereafter Cripps
brought in casually that, now he came to think of it, he had rather a
good place for a shop where he lived—a large and airy sort of basement.
Wouldn’t Haworth like to come along and try it, just to see how it
would go? He needn’t stay if he didn’t like it. Just call it a visit
or something like that. He, Mr. Cripps, would be delighted to have him
there—that is, of course, if he’d care for such a thing.

The young fellow sat thinking for quite a time. Finally he looked up,
and his eyes rested softly on old Cripps’s face as he asked in his
quiet and serious way, “What kind of power could we have?” And old
Cripps knew that the game was his.

A small trunk held all of Haworth’s personal belongings, but two crates
were required for the shipping of his mechanical devices that he
couldn’t leave behind.

       *       *       *       *       *

Old Cripps was on edge for the few days following their arrival,
fearing the boy would be disappointed or lonely, perhaps even homesick;
the mansion itself, now that he came to figure how it might affect
the young man, seemed hideously vast and hopelessly dismal—the huge
high-ceilinged rooms, the empty echoing halls, the whole place gloomy
and overcast from the great elms standing close about.

But the young man appeared to notice nothing of all these things; on
the contrary, he fell in quietly and easily with the methods and habits
of the diminutive household.

The large basement room he was to have for a shop was thoroughly
cleaned and double flooring laid. It was ceiled and painted white;
electric lights were installed, and an electric motor for power. Old
Cripps had a mechanical expert come out to go over with Haworth the
matter of the various machines and apparatus required, and insisted
that every one of them must be of the best and most modern type. A
lathe, a shaper, two drill presses, and an emery wheel were put in
at the time; some months later another lathe for larger work was
added. Also there was a bench with vises, and all the small tools and
accessories necessary to complete a machine shop.

Opening off the main room was a smaller one with the fittings for a
drafting room, and a large rough-boarded-off space in the ell of the
basement was cleared out for the finished machines and inventions and
working models that Haworth desired to store there. These came from
Montreal (after infinite trouble with the customs) and were set up
in this place. Altogether the little plant was quite complete in all
important particulars, and thereafter it was always delightful to Mr.
Cripps to add to its equipment at the slightest hint from Haworth. For
the old man was more and more taken with the young one as the days went
by. Haworth’s gentle and charming personality, his quiet sincerity
and straightforwardness, were singularly appealing. But added to this
for old Cripps was the effect of the vast contrast between this clean,
simple-minded, almost childlike young fellow and the dissolute loafer
of a nephew he had so long endured.

It was an odd little household, the two composing it differing so
greatly in their ages, tastes, and temperaments, yet living in that
vast and gloomy mansion in perfect harmony and content, neither of them
saying much, yet thoroughly enjoying each other’s company.

Mr. Cripps became intensely interested in the young fellow’s work,
too, appreciating enthusiastically the extraordinary ingenuity of his
devices and altogether overlooking the drawback which they invariably
seemed to have of not being in the line of popular demand. He had
application made—in Haworth’s name of course—for patents on several of
the most important. And when notice came from Washington that patents
had been allowed, the old gentleman fell to dancing and prancing
about like a rheumatic schoolboy, Haworth standing silent but smiling
serenely at him as he careened ponderously about the room.

       *       *       *       *       *

They had three years and four months of this life together, and then
the summons came for the old man. Some sort of stroke, I think; but no
matter—it did for him. Not at once, but the next thing to it. A couple
of days or thereabouts. He tried to tell Haworth something about the
property before he went, but couldn’t manage it. The young man sat
silent and looked at him wide-eyed like some timid animal distressed
and fearful.

Everything was left to Haworth. This included the house and grounds—on
which there was a mortgage—and a few thousand dollars in the bank,
doubtless the remnant of the money so obtained. That was all, of value.
Quite an enormous lot of worthless stocks, mostly mining, were found in
his safe-deposit boxes.

Henry P. Trescott, who had been old Cripps’s legal adviser, attended
to matters connected with the will, and if it hadn’t been for his
suggestions Haworth would never have thought of cutting down the
expenses of the establishment. He did what Trescott advised—discharged
all the servants except the cook and one maid, closed the entire
north side of the house, and had the telephones and more than half
the electric-light bulbs removed. It isn’t likely Haworth would have
consented to these economies but for Trescott’s assurance that if he
didn’t it would be but a brief time before he’d have to give up the
house and all that it contained. The lawyer at first advised selling
the place, but to that Haworth wouldn’t agree. The house itself didn’t
matter so much—it was the shop and all his things down there, and the
quiet surroundings.

Trescott also looked over Haworth’s work and occasionally sent out
people who might be interested. But no one was. And after a time the
young inventor grew to dislike having people come, knowing so well that
they’d go away again with awkward regrets for having troubled him.
One day when a caller was announced, he sent word by the maid that he
was busy and couldn’t see anyone. The result was so gratifying that
soon he came to rely on this expedient altogether. Thereafter he led a
perfectly quiet and uninterrupted existence, devoting himself to the
work he loved, undisturbed by events of any kind. The loss of his
generous and sympathetic companion had affected him deeply, and often
he was beset with an aching loneliness. But always he could retreat
into the safe sanctuary of mechanics—the perfect absorption in his
inventive pursuits—where loneliness and grief were successfully held at
bay.

His time was mostly spent in his shop or drafting room, but he liked to
walk when there were problems on his mind. He had certain places for
certain kinds of problems: along a nearby section of railroad track,
for one; a lonely little path in a patch of woods and weeds and bushes
about a mile down the road, for another, and so on. Franklin Park
wouldn’t do at all, for he was likely to meet people there; as to that,
so would he on the railroad, but there it would only be men, and the
sort he didn’t mind—working chaps, machinists, engineers, switchmen,
and trainmen on the way to work or home from it.




PART IV


One late April afternoon—a chilly dismal day it had been, with a
drizzle of rain—the maid knocked at his workroom door, and when he’d
shut down the power on the drill he was using, she told him a lady and
gentleman were at the door asking to see him, and they didn’t give any
name.

“Busy,” he answered mechanically, and was turning back to his work.

“Excuse me sir, but the gentleman said, though you wouldn’t know him,
he’s a near relative of old Mr. Cripps as used to live here.”

“Oh!” (Long pause.) “Relative.”

“Yes sir.”

“Lady with him, you say?”

“Yes sir, there is.” This maid, whose name was Hulda, had been there
only a few weeks.

After a long consideration of the matter, turning it this way and that
in his mind, Haworth abandoned hope of finding some way out of it, and
told the maid to show them into the hall and say he’d come soon. He got
out of his jumpers, washed his hands, and went upstairs.

Both the man and woman rose as he came toward them from the rear hall.
The man stepped forward a little.

“Mr. Haworth?”

“Yes.”

“It’s very kind of you to see us, but perhaps you wouldn’t have done
it if I’d sent in my name. I thought it was only right to give me a
chance to explain.”

Haworth’s calm brown-eyed gaze was upon the man. “Explain what?” he
asked, softly—almost timidly.

“You’ll know well enough when I tell you that I’m Augustus Findlay....
Yes, I’m Augustus Findlay,” he repeated, as the first announcement of
the fact appeared not to have produced the effect expected, “an’ I’m
not ashamed to own it!”

“What did you want to see me about?”

“That’s just what I expected! Just it, by God! It’s what I looked for,
to be treated as a stranger!” And turning to his companion who was
standing a little back of him, “Didn’t I tell you how it would be?” And
to Haworth: “Of course the old man poisoned your mind against me. What
else could you expect? He never had a kind word for me, Mr. Haworth—not
one! It was pure animosity and hatred—and he my uncle, too!”

Haworth regarded him calmly for a moment.

“Who is your uncle?” he finally asked.

“Aw, what’s the good o’ pretending you don’t know who I mean! Pretty
rank that is, if you ask me!”

And then, as Haworth said nothing in the pause allotted to him, he
went on in a loud and blatant tone: “It’s old man Cripps I’m talking
about—the one you’ve been living with for the last three or four years
until he died and left you all his money—an’ this place along with it,
I suppose!”

“I’m sorry,” Haworth murmured. And then, after a pause, “Did he know
about you?”

“Know about me!” Findlay turned back to the young woman with a bitter
laugh. “That’s pretty neat now, isn’t it?... Why,” (to Haworth) “I
lived here in the house with him all my life until just before you came
along! _All my life by God!_”

“And—you went away then?”

“Well, I didn’t exactly—I didn’t so much——You ain’t kiddin’ me, are
you? Didn’t he ever tell you about it?”

Haworth shook his head slightly.

“Well” (turning to his companion) “can you beat that? The old man
was——Oh, I beg your pardon! This is my wife, Edith. Mr. Haworth—Mr.
_Charles_ Haworth, I believe it is!” The girl—for she was only that—put
out her hand timidly and Haworth took it.

“Now we haven’t come here as beggars, Mr. Haworth. I said to Edith we’d
never do a thing like that. Didn’t I say it?” turning to his girlish
wife.

She shook her head almost imperceptibly and glanced down in evident
distress.

“No, I should think not!” He, in a measure, answering for her. “Don’t
run away with the idea we’re that kind! Never more mistaken in your
life!” And Findlay went on, becoming rather loud about it. “Far from
it! We’re not that sort! But I’ll say this much, Mr. Haworth,—that
matters haven’t gone right with us for some little time. No, they
haven’t, and that’s a fact! We’ve certainly been up against it at every
turn of the cards and we’re pretty close to being up against it now.”

Haworth’s eyes were steadily on Augustus as he talked. Only once did
they shift for an instant to the girl.

“Now I wouldn’t go to any stranger,” Findlay went on; “no, not even
to an ordinary friend you know,—for—ah—for advice at such a time.
But I lived here all my life, an’ owing to blind prejudice an’
slander—that’s what it was, Mr. Haworth—I lost out on the will.
Everything went to you. God knows I don’t complain of that! But in a
time of trouble like this it seems only proper and decent to come to
you for advice.”

Haworth spoke after a little pause. “Advice?” (Almost in a whisper).

“Yes, Mr. Haworth, that’s what I want! I need some one to tell me what
to do, for I don’t know which way to turn. Of course, if out of the
fullness of your heart you can—help us a little—just till I get on my
feet——”

He broke off to give Haworth a chance to say something, but the young
inventor did not speak.

“Why it’s as bad as this, Mr. Haworth, though I hate like hell to tell
you! We haven’t actually—we haven’t actually any idea where we’re going
to sleep to-night! That’s God’s truth!”

“There’s plenty of room here,” Haworth murmured in a low voice.

“Why, but you——I—I’d no idea of such a——Edith dear, do you hear that?”

The girl smiled a little doubtfully, and looked at Haworth.

Augustus went right along piling words on top of Haworth’s implied
offer as if hoping to bury it so deep it couldn’t be withdrawn.

“My God! But that’s a great relief! You’ve no idea! It’s certainly
splendid of you, Mr. Haworth! You really mean we can put up here with
you for a bit? Wouldn’t make you trouble for the world or impose on
your kindness, but if—if you _can_ manage it—just till I get on my feet
again—I can’t tell how much—how——”

“Come upstairs,” Haworth said, “and see which room you’d like.” He led
the way to the floor above.

The large room at the front of the house on the south side (the north
side wasn’t in use, you’ll remember) was finally decided upon for the
Findlays. Haworth occupied a smaller one quite a distance back on the
same corridor. There were several rooms and two or three bathrooms
between.

When they came down he took them into the living room—that is to say,
the room he used as such. It was a vast panelled apartment with a
marble mantel and fireplace, and had been the dining room back in the
old Cripps days. The chamber chosen by Augustus for the use of his wife
and himself was directly above the front part of it.

Findlay now began a long recital of his misfortunes, telling with
acrimony how he’d lost this position and that, always through no fault
of his own. Now and then he managed to bring in references to his
uncle, all tending to impress one with the idea that he had been most
unjustly treated.

Haworth’s steady gaze, not for an instant leaving his face as he talked
on, began to disturb Augustus. It gave him the feeling of being under
calm and critical observation—which, in fact, he was. So before he’d
gone far in his pathetic narrative he began to stumble about and lose
track of what he was saying, and finally he rose suddenly, announcing
that he’d completely forgotten about their trunks, which were at the
South Station—for it seemed they had come in from somewhere—and he’d go
and bring them out if Mr. Haworth didn’t mind.

Mr. Haworth didn’t mind at all and said so, and Findlay got his coat
and hat and was just going out of the front door when he suddenly
stopped, remembering something. Then he called back into the room
asking Haworth if he could come out there just a moment—he’d like to
speak to him.

“Awfully sorry, old chap,” he said in a carefully lowered voice when
they were at the door together, “but could you—ah——You see I—I’m
ashamed to say I haven’t got enough to pay an expressman. If I can once
get the trunks out here we’ll be all right—if you don’t mind giving me
a bit of a loan for that.”

“I see,” said Haworth, and he turned and went upstairs.

The moment he was out of sight Augustus stepped quickly to the door of
the living room, and putting his head in, spoke to his wife in a sharp
half whisper: “No monkey business now! If you give away anything you’ll
be sorry for it!” And hearing steps near the top of the stairs he was
instantly back at the front door again, waiting.

Haworth came down with a ten-dollar bill which he handed to Findlay,
and the latter thanked him effusively and left the house. Haworth stood
for a moment in thought, then went back into the living room. Edith
Findlay looked up at him as he came in, and he stopped with his eyes on
her, seeing that she was going to speak.

But it seemed hard for her to do so.

“Oh, I’m sorry!” she finally said in a sort of breathless whisper.

He thought it over and then said, “Why?”

“I didn’t want to come—I tried to stop him.” Her voice had a soft
huskiness that was strangely appealing. Her glance flitted painfully
about the room, and she turned to him again.

“It’ll be so terrible for you!”

“You needn’t worry about me,” he said quietly, his eyes resting softly
on her face.

“I can’t help it. I——No!” She suddenly stood up.

“We mustn’t stay, Mr. Haworth. I’ll find him and tell him so!”

“Don’t do that,” he said.

“Oh, but I——Mr. Haworth you—you don’t understand!”

“Not very well,—but you’ll tell me I hope.... No,—sit down first—this
chair.” And as he moved nearer she sank into the old upholstered chair
he indicated.

“Where could you go?” he asked as he stood before her.

“Oh——” She waved her hand as if such a matter was of no consequence.
“That’s—that’s nothing!”

“Nothing for him perhaps, but——” He broke off, looking down into her
upturned eyes.

A little spasmodic shiver passed over her. Haworth stepped quickly to
the fireplace where wood and kindlings were ready laid. He knelt there,
lighting a match and holding it to the shavings and small splinters.

She seemed somehow like a child, sitting there so small and demure in
the big armchair. A child in distress, for from her face you’d hardly
think she’d had any sleep for a week, and her dress was pitifully worn
and shabby.

As Haworth was kneeling at the fireplace he turned to ask her
something. The quick flaming of the shavings and small stuff threw a
bright light on her poor little run-over shoes. He stopped motionless
looking at them, then leaned over without getting to his feet and
touched one. At once he rose and walked around behind her chair,
which he pushed and turned until her feet were as near the fire as he
thought would do. Then he pushed an electric button near the door.

“You may not know it,” he said as he stood waiting, “but you’re going
to drink some hot tea—something near two hundred and twelve in the
shade. Also, you’re going to have dry things for your feet, even if you
have to shuffle about in something of mine!”

The maid came and he told her to make tea—the hottest kind she ever
heard of—and to bring things with it—toast or whatever it was—she
knew. Then he went on to ask what she could do about footwear for Mrs.
Findlay, who was cold and wet and also very tired; and wouldn’t Hulda
please take charge of her and arrange things satisfactorily?

Hulda said she thought she could manage if the lady wouldn’t mind
wearing some of her things, and Haworth said he was sure she
wouldn’t—and over his shoulder toward Edith, “You wouldn’t, would you?”
And he saw the top of her little round hat above the back of the chair
shaking slightly for “no” and heard a very faint sniffle, and told
Hulda it would be all right. Upon which the maid departed to attend to
everything.

Haworth stood uncertain a moment, for the first sniffle had alarmed
him, as he realized that he wouldn’t have an idea what to do if Mrs.
Findlay was actually crying. He earnestly hoped she wasn’t, yet had
a fairly trustworthy intuition that such a thing was at that moment
transpiring; and it occurred to him that if this was so, the correct
and possibly even the noble behavior might be to go away and leave
her. On the other hand, something might be seriously the matter, and
probably was, otherwise why should such a thing be going on?

This latter seemed the most sensible view, and on arriving at it he
went over very quietly and stood by the marble mantel, which brought
him quite near and almost in front of her.

She was dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief every now and then, and
as the firelight flickered on the hand that was doing it, he couldn’t
help seeing that it was a perfect dear of a little hand. He didn’t
understand how he could be thinking of this at such a time, when she
was in evident distress; but for a moment he couldn’t think of anything
else. And the diminutive wad of crumpled handkerchief,—also the wet
and worn-out little shoes, appealed to him in some peculiar way that
brought on, deep down in his system, an almost unbearable ache.

Suddenly she looked up at him.

“Do you know what I ought to do?”

He shook his head as he stood looking down at her.

“I ought to run out of the house this—this very instant.”

She glanced anxiously about as if meditating flight, which, in fact,
she was.

“What for?” Haworth asked.

“For you,” she said.

The shadow of a smile passed over Haworth’s face.

“That wouldn’t do _me_ any good.”

“Oh, it would—it would!” she cried out. “Because our being here is
going to—to——” She was unable to go on.

“What is it going to do?” he finally asked.

She looked at him steadily for a moment, and then shook her head a
little, but did not speak.

“Please tell me this: Is it true that your husband is Mr. Cripps’s
nephew?”

“Yes, Mr. Haworth.”

“Then, even though it’s going to be so terrible, I’d rather have him
stay. Mr. Cripps never said anything about having a nephew. I’m afraid
there was some injustice done.”

Edith was looking up in his face, and there was something about it
that he simply couldn’t stand. The only alternative seemed to be to go
somewhere else as soon as he possibly could. Acting on this idea, he
made a considerable effort and got his eyes away from her, and spoke
quickly and mumblingly, addressing the floor.

“You know Hulda, the one you saw just now—she was here——”

“Yes, I saw her.”

“That’s the one. Well, she’ll take care of everything—tea, you know—and
dry—and warm—and—your room—and—yes.”

He turned and walked rapidly past Edith and out of the room by one
of the rear doors, thence through a back hall and down the basement
stairs, making thus an instinctive retreat to his machine shop, the
mechanical panacea for all his mental disturbances. At least he had
found it so up to now.

       *       *       *       *       *

Leaving Edith Findlay entirely in Hulda’s hands was precisely the
effective way for getting results, though no thought of it as such
entered Haworth’s mind. The maid, a neat, blue-eyed young woman of
Scandinavian origin, was greatly pleased at being allowed to take
entire charge of Mrs. Findlay, and proceeded to do so with enthusiasm.
She brought the poor child (that’s what Edith Findlay seemed to her)
hot tea and hot toast and thin sandwiches, and had her in dry stockings
and warm slippers before anyone—provided only that he stammered
badly—could have said “Jack Robinson.” At once after that she had an
open fire burning in the room above and the covers of the furniture
off and thorough sweeping and dusting done. Then she returned to Edith,
and gave it as her opinion that the thing for her to do was to go to
bed and rest herself. So positive was Hulda of the benefits to be
derived from “just a few winks, Mrs. Findlay,” that Edith was swept to
the room on the wave of her enthusiasm on the subject, and put snugly
to bed.

But weary as she was, the realization of what must surely happen when
Augustus returned, kept her in a condition of worried wakefulness. She
knew so well what the interview at the door meant. He had got money
from Mr. Haworth. There was no question in her mind as to what he would
do with it, and, as a result, in what condition he would return to
the house at two or three in the morning. If it could only be that he
could come in and get to bed and to sleep without creating a terrifying
disturbance, she would consider it serene and heavenly rest compared to
what was to be expected, for he had reached the condition where alcohol
came near to making a maniac of him. Shouts and curses and horrible
songs; the throwing about of whatever came to his hand; the threatening
of her, sometimes with a revolver—an enormous thing which he insisted
on keeping under his pillow—all this was to be expected if he had money
enough to buy drinks. And if Mr. Haworth had given him anything it was
enough, for there were no trunks to spend it on; all that was pure
fiction. Everything they owned had gone to the pawnshops long ago.

As it happened, however, her anxiety as to the home-coming of Augustus
was misplaced. It should have been applied to future occasions. Findlay
came in at a quarter before seven, a trifle electrified, to be sure,
but not to a voltage that was shocking.

The three sat down to dinner in what had once been the breakfast
room—opening off the present living room at its rear end, opposite the
swing door of the butler’s pantry. It was, for that house, a rather
small, cheerful place with a big bay window on the south side.

At this meal Augustus conversed with himself brilliantly. Haworth
said little, but looked smilingly on in his detached way. Edith,
who said hardly anything, stole an occasional glance at him. Hulda
waited on them. A cat came in from somewhere and entered pleas for
refreshments,—not in vain.

When dinner was over the three went back to the large room, Haworth
sitting there with his guests for half an hour or so; then, excusing
himself, and telling them that breakfast was whenever they asked for it
(he remembered old Cripps used to tell his visitors that), he went down
to his shop in the basement.

He had an unusual experience there—something quite unexpected for him.
He found that, for some reason, he was utterly unable to keep his mind
on his work—work which had always so completely engrossed him that he
had often found it impossible, when he ought to have done so, to keep
his mind away from it.

He had begun on the first rough draft of a problem that had been on his
mind for days, and only that morning he had got it. Consequently he was
more than eager to get it down on paper. But again and again after he
had started on the sketch, he would suddenly rouse himself to find that
he was sitting with pencil poised, doing nothing. He would seem to
wake up from something and find himself in this extraordinary situation.

On making a startled inquiry of himself as to the cause of this unusual
phenomenon, he realized at once that the chief trouble—or at least
the chief diversion—was a pair of the most exquisite hands, though
sometimes two tired little feet in worn-out shoes would share the
guilt; and even an appealing face with dark troubled eyes looking up at
him was now and again responsible. But why shouldn’t he have his guests
on his mind? It was a most astonishing affair, this coming of Mr.
Cripps’s nephew and his wife. Probably this accounted for everything.

Finally, after a couple of hours of useless effort, he gave up the
struggle and allowed his thoughts to dwell in peace on Edith Findlay.
He went over and over in his mind everything she had said or done and
looked. What a pathetic and helpless little figure! And there was her
husband—a most objectionable sort of thing. Most likely that was the
trouble—something wrong with him. Liquor—drugs—it might be anything.
Think of the fellow not bringing the trunks out with him, knowing his
wife had nothing! He would see to it himself in the morning. Yet how
wonderfully she had managed to transform herself in some way—her hair
so becomingly arranged. Really, it was extraordinary. Perhaps Hulda had
lent her some of the things. And now he thought of it, how nice it was
of Hulda to take such an interest. He hadn’t really appreciated her
before.

After a time it occurred to him that he ought to go up and see if there
was anything he could do to make his guests, in the absence of their
trunks, more comfortable for the night. Yes, it certainly was his duty
as host to do what he could.

On reaching the living room, however, he found that they’d gone
upstairs, so he stood awhile looking at the chair one of them had been
sitting in, and remembering how she had looked up at him when he rolled
that same chair, with her in it, close up to the fire. From that he
went on to recall other things and to run the pictures over and over
again in his mind. Finally, when he came to himself, it was very late
indeed.

       *       *       *       *       *

Haworth was an early riser, and the next morning Hulda, hearing him
in his machine shop in the basement, took him down a pot of coffee
with toast and a cereal, as she always did when he went down there
before breakfast; for if he once got absorbed in his work the idea of
coming up would never occur to him. She found him at his drawing board,
apparently considering something very carefully before getting it down
on paper. Hearing her come in, he roused himself and looked up blankly.

“Your coffee, sir,” she said; and placed the tray within his reach.

He thanked her and at once poured out some, for he’d been sitting there
most of the night and felt the need of it, now the matter was brought
to his attention.

As the maid was going out he stopped her with, “Oh, Hulda! It was—it
was good of you to take care of Mrs. Findlay so—so nicely.”

“I was glad to, sir,” she responded after an instant of surprise, for
Mr. Haworth so seldom noticed anything. “Indeed I was, sir, for she’s
a sweet little body. If you’ll excuse me saying it, it must be awful
for ’er with that man.”

Haworth turned, surprised, and looked at the maid.

“What do you know about him?” he asked.

“Well, I—I can see ’im, sir, an’ that’s something!”

Haworth was silent.

“And besides, cook tells me the cook before _her_ was saying things
about a terrible person used to live here, until one day in the middle
of the night ole Mr. Cripps threw ’im out o’ the house an’ kicked ’im
down the front steps; an’ when I was putting towels in their bathroom
yesterday I heard ’im telling ’er how different things was when ’e
lived here, so I can’t but think it’s ’im.”

Haworth looked silently at her for a moment and then said: “Yes. Well,
tell me when they’ve finished breakfast. I want to see them about their
trunks.”

Some two hours later the maid came down and told him. But when he went
upstairs Augustus had left the house and Mrs. Findlay had gone to her
room. Haworth went up and knocked at the door. She opened it.

“Oh!” she said with a little gasp. “I was afraid you were angry!”

“Angry?”

“Yes.” She was looking down, but soon raised her eyes to his. Suddenly
she thought of the disordered room and stepped out into the hallway
beside him, closing the door after her.

“What made you think so?” he asked, after his eyes had rested on her in
silence a moment.

“You didn’t come to breakfast at all!”

“Oh, _that_!” Haworth smiled. “I nearly always don’t.”

“Don’t you have any?”

“Yes, but when I’m down working Hulda brings it to me.”

“Oh!” She seemed relieved. “I was afraid it was because you—because we
were here.”

He shook his head a little and muttered, “No.”

“It’ll be so some time,” she said, scarcely above a whisper.

“You’re mistaken about that,” he told her gently.

She looked at him with eyes showing gratitude, yet with it the painful
conviction that she was right.

“Did Mr. Findlay take the checks with him?” he asked.

She looked at him, not understanding.

“The checks for the trunks,” he explained.

“Oh! No, he—he didn’t!”

“There’s a truckman over at Jamaica Plain,” Haworth said. “He often
hauls for me—that is, he used to. He’ll have the trunks here by noon.
So if you’ll give the checks——”

“I—I don’t know where they——” She stopped for an instant, then turned
and looked him in the face. “There aren’t any checks,” she said in a
low voice.

Haworth was silent, his calm gaze upon her.

“There aren’t any checks—or trunks—or _anything_!” Having made this
sweeping confession, she stood guiltily before him as though she’d
acknowledged complicity in a bank robbery.

“But you have some things—_somewhere_!” he finally asked in a gentle
voice, trying not to hurt her.

She shook her head a little without looking up. “You see—you see, we
_did_ have some trunks. We _had_ them—but——”

“Yes yes, I know,” he said softly, his hand touching her shoulder in
sympathy for an instant. “It’s a tough thing for you, losing everything
like that, but it’s simply wonderful for me! Yes, it is,” (seeing her
look of amazement) “for it gives me the chance to do something that
I—that I like doing so very much indeed!”

“I’m afraid I don’t exactly——What is it?”

“Why—why nothing at all, only to get you a few little things you’ll
need. Hulda can do it; we’ll leave it all to her.... And then you’ll be
wearing something that I——”

He stopped, seeing that Edith had turned away and was fumbling with the
door knob.

“But Mrs. Findlay,” he said, quickly, “I didn’t mean to—won’t you
please——”

But she was shaking her head as she finally got the door open, and he
heard an indistinct, “No——I can’t!” as she fled blindly through it into
her room, closing it quickly after her.

Haworth stood motionless before the door—which had almost been shut in
his face, and a great fear nearly stopped his heart from beating—the
fear that she was angry with him.

After standing some time quite unable to figure it out, he suddenly
thought of Hulda, and hurrying down to the room on the left, rang the
bell; after which he waited in a state of near-panic till she came.

“Hulda,” he said the instant she appeared, “I’ve offended Mrs. Findlay
seriously! Yes, I’m afraid I have! Do you know anything that could be
done?”

“What makes you think it, sir? Did she say anything?”

“No—not exactly; but while I was talking to her she turned and ran into
her room and shut the door.”

“What were you saying to ’er, Mr. Haworth? That might be it.”

“It couldn’t be! I was only telling her that I was going to have you
get her some things to—to wear you know—because all their trunks are
lost, you see.”

“I don’t think she’s angry.” Hulda had a smile concealed somewhere.
“It’s most likely just feelings, sir.”

“Feelings?”

“Yes sir—about you being that kind to ’er, I’d say.”

“Are you quite sure that was all?”

“Indeed I am, sir, but when she’s had a little time I’ll go up and see
to the room—they got up so late it isn’t done yet—an’ then I’ll hear
what she says.”

“Yes, do that! And if it _is_ so—as you think—and there’s no trouble of
any kind, I want you to go to town with her as soon as you can and help
about getting the things.”

“Yes sir. An’ what was you thinking of getting?”

“Oh yes. Well you’d know that, wouldn’t you? Things to wear, of
course—dresses and—and—and so on. She must have things to use,
too—brushes and combs and shaving soap—no, other soap, I mean—and hair
things—you know, to hold it up and all that. Get whatever there is,
Hulda; she hasn’t anything at all. That makes it quite simple, doesn’t
it?”

“Yes sir; she wants to be fitted out.”

“That’s it—fitted out! And oh, there’s one thing—yes, shoes. Be very
careful about that, Hulda! I want her to have some perfectly delightful
shoes—the nicest you can get, and quite a lot of them—all she can use.
And oh, another thing—gloves. Quite extraordinary gloves! Don’t forget
those two things, Hulda—shoes—gloves. They’re really the most important
of all!”

“I’ll do my best, sir.”

“And about the dresses—several different varieties—all of them the most
satisfactory in every respect. And then—get the—the—” (making motions
up and down his body to illustrate) “underthings, you know. Don’t
fail to have them the nicest that are made. I’m sure this is a very
important—er—phase of the matter.”

“Yes sir, it is.”

“And hats—of course she’ll need a few of those. And some fur
things—don’t fail to get some fur things. She was shivering yesterday.”

“I’ll do the best I can, Mr. Haworth, but wouldn’t it be better to
buy easy at first? Say, to-day a ready-made dress or two an’ a pair
o’ shoes an’ a few things, an’ let the rest come gradual? I’m only
thinking of ’er feelings as not being equal to it if all the things was
to come at a jump, as one might say.”

“That’s perfectly true. Her feelings must be treated with the greatest
care!” He glanced at the stairway through the open door.

“I’ll go upstairs now, sir; but I’m sure you needn’t to feel uneasy
about it.”

And Hulda went up the stairway and a moment later could be heard gently
knocking at Mrs. Findlay’s door.

When he finally heard Hulda coming down again his heart pounded so
violently that he was sure it shook him. A mechanical notion flashed
in his mind that his pumping plant was too powerful for the frame. He
found himself, too, hardly able to turn and face the maid when she
came to the door.

“It’s all right, sir,” she said. “An’ we’ll be going in as soon as I
finish the rooms. An’ if you please, sir, she’d like to speak to you
before we go.”

The relief was unspeakable. She wasn’t angry or offended. And she’d
wear things that he gave her.

So everything was arranged and Haworth gave Hulda enough money for the
first day, not noticing or thinking for an instant that he was making
an ugly excavation in what was supposed to carry him on for a year.
When the maid had gone for her hat and cloak, Haworth waited about in
the hall. At last he heard Edith coming down and went to meet her at
the foot of the stairs.

Seeing him, she stopped before she was quite down. The thought came
to him that he wished she could stay there—on the stairs—a little
above him—instead of going to town. Couldn’t that, perhaps, be put off
until the next day? Her voice, slightly tremulous, interrupted his
meditations.

“I’m awfully sorry I acted so,” was what she said. “Please forgive me.”

He looked up in her face, drinking in with his eyes something
indescribable and inconceivable that came to him from hers.

“I’ll be so glad,” she went on after the briefest pause, “to wear
anything that you——” suddenly putting out her hand, “oh, you’re so
kind!”

It was incredible! At this time yesterday he had been unaware that
she existed; now he was unaware that anything else did. But there was
hardly time to realize it before the hand was gone and she was moving
toward the door; and very soon Hulda came and the two went off together.

Haworth stood in the doorway and watched them go down the great stone
steps and along the curved drive to Torrington Road. Then he came
slowly in, closed the door, and stood thinking—or rather, remembering.
Not one word had he said to her since she came down. Going over every
smallest detail of what had occurred, he couldn’t find any place where
he had said anything. But why should he? There didn’t seem to be
anything to say. As a matter of fact he had no idea at all of what had
happened to him.

From this you’ll understand why he had no slightest sense of guilt or
trespass. It didn’t disturb him when Findlay came back from the city
and borrowed twenty dollars—an amount, he told Haworth, that would
enable him to take advantage of an extraordinary business opportunity
which had presented itself.

       *       *       *       *       *

Hulda brought Mrs. Findlay and a large number of packages home in a
taxi about a quarter before five. Haworth was down in his workshop,
where he managed, by the exertion of enormous will power, to do a few
little pieces of manual labor on one of the lathes. His being unable
to concentrate on his work had worried him quite a bit. But although
he was entirely aware that Edith was tremendously attractive to him
in many ways, it did not occur to him to connect that circumstance
with what seemed to him a failing intellect so far as mechanics was
concerned.

Hulda descended to the basement to report to Haworth on the shopping
tour, which had resulted in not only what they had brought home, but
several articles that were to be fitted later.

“Tell me what you did about the shoes?” he inquired, without the least
effort to conceal his eagerness for information on that subject.

“Oh yes, sir! There’s lovely ones for the house an’ two kinds for the
street, that’s most beautiful on ’er. Wait till you see ’em, sir!”

“I will,” said Haworth, and went on with his screw-cutting at the
lathe, though his mind had absented itself entirely from mechanical
pursuits. Fortunately the process was largely automatic, so no serious
damage was done.

At half-past six he went to his room and got into a fairly good suit of
clothes. He’d never given anything that could be called “thought” to
what he wore, further than to have it clean, and so far as possible not
torn or otherwise mutilated. Old Mr. Cripps, during the time the two
were living together, had frequently taken him to his own tailor and
ordered clothing for him in a most generous way. Since the old man’s
death, however, Haworth had been to that place only once, on which
occasion he had asked them to make him two suits, one thin, the other
thick. But when they began to unroll the vast cylinders of “imported
goods” before him, he had started for the door, muttering quite audibly
that it was their business to find the stuff to make them of, not his.

Edith came down in a charming slip of a dress they’d found. It had
needed no alteration, so she could have it for that evening.

Haworth, waiting in the living room, fixed his eyes on her in calm
astonishment. He would hardly have known her. It wasn’t the dress
alone, but everything, including herself.

She found herself standing still just inside the door, his steadfast
gaze of amazement and admiration acting like an automatic signal set
against her.

“Please sit here,” he said, after a moment of regarding her in silence,
and indicating the big chair she’d been sitting in the day before when
he lighted the fire.

She looked up at him from the depths of the chair with wide-eyed
questioning.

After he’d stood looking at her a moment or two with a peculiar
expression, he said, suddenly: “Come along—let’s have dinner!”

And she never got the answer—anyway not then—to her optical
interrogation points. Which was, that he wanted to see her feet in
their ravishing new slippers, just where he’d seen them the day before
in the poor little worn and downtrodden shoes.

And there they were, these two by themselves, at dinner. Mr. Augustus
Findlay, running true to form (about the only thing to which he did),
failed to put in an appearance. He was otherwise engaged in low-lived
haunts, with a twenty-dollar bill.

And there they were again, these two, sitting by the fire in the
evening, quietly talking and occasionally silent for a space; going
down to see his shop; then each apparently reading a book—though
neither of them read a single word. And so it went on for a number of
days.

Everything seemed to be against them—pushing them toward the edge of
the precipice. Even the maid Hulda, who must have seen the danger, was
assisting their approach to it instead of trying to hold them back;
for which questionable behavior her opinion of Mr. Findlay was largely
responsible, her sympathetic attitude toward what is roughly referred
to as “romance” perhaps accounting for the rest.

       *       *       *       *       *

But something shortly happened that not only showed them where they
were going, but flashed them an idea of the distance they’d gone.

It was the night of the ninth day after the Findlays had arrived at
the mansion. Augustus during this time, had made what were, for him,
supreme efforts to control himself, knowing very well that a great
deal depended on it. He and his wife had been taken in and provided
with a home free of cost and containing among its other furniture a
soft-hearted boob out of whom he could apparently squeeze what money he
needed, if he was careful to handle it right. Haworth was certainly an
utter fool, but even at that he might be troublesome if once aroused.
Though by no means of powerful build, he was a bit too husky to take a
chance on.

For a while Findlay managed to avoid displays of himself that would be
positively objectionable. But as these nine days wore on he seemed to
be losing his grip on himself, such as it was. He was coming home later
and later each night and making more and more of a disturbance each
time he did it.

Haworth had several times been awakened in the small hours of the
morning by the slamming of doors and the shouting of oaths and lines
out of what are called, for want of a worse name, songs. However, as
the noise and uproar seemed to subside when Findlay finally got himself
upstairs, Haworth waited for that relief, though with a sharp agony
of pain at the thought of Edith having to endure the presence of the
intoxicated loafer.

This had been going on for more than a week, and, as I say, growing
steadily worse, when a night came that the raucous clamor failed to
diminish on Findlay’s getting upstairs and into the room that he and
his wife occupied. It was somewhat muffled after the door closed, but
even then oaths and abuse could be heard, and violent demands for
something.

Haworth’s room was farther back on the same corridor, and the
old-fashioned transom above the door was open. At first he couldn’t
make out what the half-crazy sot was trying to get from her, as he was
evidently making an effort to keep his voice down; but soon excitement
or anger made him raise it, and Haworth could hear his shouted demands
for a key to something.

Edith was saying nothing. All that could be heard were the threats and
imprecations of her husband. Suddenly this stopped, then a quick and
frightened, “_Oh no!_” from Edith, followed at once by deeper threats
and in the midst of them a subdued scream and the sound of the door
flung open.

Haworth had sprung from his bed at the very instant of Edith’s scream
and was through the door and out in the corridor just as she came
running out of her room, followed by her husband. He was flourishing a
big revolver and lurching this way and that as he came.

Haworth started up the hall toward them, but Edith had seen him and ran
into his arms, terrified. He instantly swung her around behind him so
that he was between her and Findlay, and without taking his eyes off
the latter,—who had stopped not far from the door of his room and was
staring with alcoholic malevolence at his wife and the man she was
clinging to. The light that had been left on for him in the upper hall
shone directly across them.

“Here!” he suddenly called out. “Thish has gone far enough!” And he
flourished his weapon about. “Far enough!” he repeated, and went on
mumbling threats and curses.

Haworth began gently to free himself from Edith’s frightened clinging,
at the same time pushing her back toward the door of his room.

“Don’t worry,” he told her as they moved back; “he isn’t going to hurt
anybody. I want to speak to him a minute.”

“Oh no! You mustn’t! No—_please_! He’s crazy! He doesn’t know what he’s
doing.”

“Yes—well, I thought I’d tell him.”

They’d reached his door by now.

“Could you wait here a minute—just in the doorway?... That’s it. And
please don’t come out in the hall.”

She obeyed and stood just within the door, but her eyes were looking at
him with wide anxiety. He touched her shoulder soothingly, then turned
away and walked easily up the corridor toward the liquor-crazed brute
with the gun.

“Now you wait juss precishly ware you are or I’ll plug you!” Findlay’s
speech was thick but his revolver was steady enough as he brought it
down, covering Haworth.

There wasn’t the slightest hesitation, however, on the part of that
young man as he calmly walked up to Augustus. “I’ll take that gun,” he
said.

“What!”

“That gun—there in your hand.”

Augustus stood blinking at him several seconds, then slowly lowered
his arm, and after another pause reached out the weapon toward Haworth.
The young man took it and turning toward the front of the house, sent
it crashing through the big east window of the upper hall. Then he
stepped to the open door of Findlay’s room, and taking the key out
of the inside keyhole, inserted it in the outside one. That done, he
turned to Findlay and made a slight motion to him to go in. Nothing
marked, no assumption of command, a mere side motion of the head with a
turn of the hand.

Augustus did further vacant blinking. Then, seeming to comprehend
something, he turned and walked unsteadily through the door, upon which
Haworth closed it carefully and turned the key on the outside. After
trying it to make sure the lock was holding, he went back to Edith.

She caught at him impulsively as he came to her in the doorway of his
room, and he could hear her breathing deep relief. Almost without
knowing it he had her in his arms, held close against him. He felt that
her whole body was trembling. He looked down and noticed for the first
time that she had on only a thin slip of a nightdress—one of the flimsy
things that Hulda had bought her.

“You’re cold,” he said.

“No,” she whispered. “It’s only he——How did I know but—how did I know——”

“Tell me.”

“He might have—killed you!”

“There was no danger of that.—You’re shivering! Do you mind getting
in there—in my bed—till I get some of your things?” And he pushed her
gently back into the half-dark room. “You must get warm. You must,
my—my dear.”

She still clung to him.

“Don’t go there again,” she whispered.

“But I want to get something warm for you—that fur thing.”

“You can’t. It’s locked in a drawer.”

“Where’s the key?”

“I—I——”

“Have you hidden it somewhere?”

“It’s on this string—around my neck. I didn’t want him to get it.”

“Get it! For what?”

She wouldn’t say any more. But even as he asked the question he
knew—for the money he might raise on it.

“Let me have the key,” he said.

“No, please!” she remonstrated. “You mustn’t go—you mustn’t. When he
drinks he’s out of his mind—a maniac; you don’t know what terrible
things he might do.”

“He can’t do much now—his gun’s out there in the grass.”

She stared up at Haworth.

“Was that it—when the glass broke?”

He nodded.

After a moment she undid the string and gave him the key. But her hands
were trembling.

“Does he do this often?” Haworth inquired.

“Not with—with one of those things.”

“Gun, you mean?”

He could feel her head nodding “yes” as it rested against him.

“But last night,” she went on, “he—told me—if I didn’t give him the
key to-night he’d——” A slight shudder passed over her.

“Nothing like that’ll happen here, so please don’t worry.”

She looked up in his face, which she could just see—a whiteness in the
gloom.

“I didn’t mind so much till he fired it once,—not—not _at_ me, but I
didn’t know that, and ever since I can’t—seem to——” She shuddered again
in his arms.

“He won’t fire it again.... Your hands are like ice. Do please crawl in
there and pull the blankets over you.”

And he urged her toward the disordered pillows.

When she had turned and moved away in the dimness, Haworth went back to
the Findlay room and unlocked the door. Taking the key out of the lock,
he stepped inside, closed the door and locked it again, putting the key
in the pocket of his pajamas.

Augustus was sitting on the bed. He appeared to be trying to figure out
what had happened to him.

“You again!” he mumbled.

Haworth didn’t take the trouble to glance in his direction but went
across to the bureau and unlocked the drawers with the key Edith had
given him, then piled the contents across his left arm, leaving his
right free for other purposes. On these things he tossed whatever
articles of feminine apparel he could find about the room, including
a pair of little fur-lined slippers which he handled with the utmost
consideration. He also made a clean sweep of the toilet articles on the
dressing table, managing to hold them on top of the other things with
his left hand backward over them. Then he returned to the door and was
taking the key out of his pocket with his free hand when Augustus spoke
again.

“You wait!” he shouted, thickly.

Haworth turned to him.

“I shay wait—you there! Do I make myself plain?”

“What is it? I’m waiting.”

“Oh, you are, eh! You’re waitin’, eh! Well, I’m damn glad to know it!
Now you juss tell me—I demand you tell me where my wife is! _You tell
me that?_”

“I’ll inform you of one thing—she’s safe from you!” And Haworth turned
back to the door.

“Now, you!” Findlay had risen heavily and was lumbering toward him.
“Now juss one minute, my frien’—juss one minute! I’ll thank you to
leave those things where they b’long!”

Haworth waited until Findlay had come blustering up to within a couple
of feet of him and stopped. The two regarded each other in silence for
a few seconds. Then the young inventor spoke in a low voice. “I’ve got
a few words to say to you in the morning,” he said, and unlocking the
door, went out, and closed and locked it again on the outside.

“Getting warm all right?” he asked, standing by the bed in the dimness
of his room.

“I think so,” came the voice of Edith, muffled by the pillows.

He put down the clothing carefully on a chair.

“I think I found everything,” he said. “You must stay here and keep
warm.” And he tried to pull the blankets closer round her neck.

“But if he comes with that—that——”

“He won’t. He’s locked in the room. And I’ll be just outside here in
the hall, not ten feet away—not ten feet. I’ll get the big chair down
the hall——”

“But—oh no—I can’t drive you out of your room like that! _I’ll_ stay
out there.” She caught at his hand and clung to it.

“But wait. Listen, darling—darling—darling——” (Now that he’d found
the word, he wanted to say it all the time.) “I’d so—so much—so
tremendously much like being there watching while you’re asleep. You
don’t know—it’s—it’s beyond words. So you must let me do that while
you’re attending to the sleeping part.” He was accustomed to the near
darkness now and could see her eyes wide open, fixed on him. “If you
want a light”—he spoke rather hurriedly—“the switch is there by the
door. Can you see it? And you’ll call me if you want anything, won’t
you?”

He tried to disengage his hand, but as she wouldn’t let it go he lifted
it so her hand came to his lips, and held it pressed against them for
a little; then gently undid her fingers and tucked her arm under the
coverlet.

“I’ll take these on the way,” he said, gathering up an armful of his
own clothes from a chair and moving toward the door.

“I’m coming too!” she suddenly announced, throwing the bedclothes back
and sliding out till her little white feet touched the floor. “If
you’re going to sit out there I’m going to sit with you!” And she began
to fumble among the things he’d brought from her room.

He stood in the doorway, considering. She surely ought to stay there
and keep warm and rest. The house was chilly. She’d be sure to—she’d
be——And at that point an idea came to him.

“I’ll build a fire downstairs if you’ll come and sit by it,” he said.

She straightened up from her search among the things on the chair and
looked at him for a second; then:

“Are you coming too?”

“Oh yes!”

“Oh!—Then I’ll be down in just a minute!”

He reached in and snapped the light on for her, closed the door, and
went downstairs. After putting on the clothes he had caught up while
leaving his room, he built a huge fire in the fireplace of the living
room.

Edith came before he’d quite finished, and he pushed the big chair
around in front of the fire for her, and another for himself as near to
it as its bloated old upholstery would allow. There was only firelight
in the room, and the two were there in it without a thought of anything
but that they were there—together. Haworth had her dear, precious,
exquisite hands in his (I’m quoting from his thoughts) and when she
fell asleep her head rested on his shoulder. Never had he imagined that
such a miraculous night was within the reach of members of the human
race—nor, indeed, had she.

       *       *       *       *       *

Of course, they knew now. Perhaps not the strength of the current that
was whirling them along, perhaps not precisely how far they’d already
been carried by it, but enough. And the first idea in the minds of both
Edith and Haworth when they came to think it over by daylight was to
resist, to attempt to get out of the rapids.

With one accord and no words spoken they set to work on the following
morning with the brave idea of behaving as though they were merely
casual acquaintances, and not, as was the actual state of things, the
custodians of each other’s lives. And they succeeded fairly well in
acting this deceitful drama whenever they chanced to meet—which was
necessarily quite often—and gave their performance as relentlessly
when no audience was there to see, as they did in the presence of
spectators. Moreover, they really tried, both of them, to avoid
meeting. There was no attempted coldness; their relationship would have
seemed to an observer to be of agreeable friendliness, nothing more.

And, as it happened, there _was_ an observer——and not only that, but a
close and eager one.

When Haworth went in to say a few words to Findlay the morning after
the latter’s revolver had been taken from him and flung through the
window, he found the fellow silent and sullen. His ideas as to what
had occurred during the night were hazy in the extreme, but these few
quiet words from Haworth cleared his atmosphere in the space of a few
seconds, and put him in the way of distinct realization of where he
stood. He had threatened his wife with a gun (he remembered having
intended to do so) and the weapon had been taken from him. He had been
locked in his room (he was already aware of this from having made
efforts to get out) and as the Haworth fellow gave it to him, not only
was Mrs. Findlay to have a separate sleeping room, but she was to
occupy it without interference or disturbance from him.

As for Haworth himself, he would sleep downstairs on a cot in his
drafting room, as he had often done before. This would give them the
entire floor to themselves. If, however, he started any of his rowdyism
again, or mistreated his wife, or threatened her with mistreatment, he
would be turned over to the police and locked up. That was all. Good
morning.

It was the matter of his wife being given a room by herself that put
a knife in him. A dull but furious jealousy began to rage somewhere
in his interior. Though he had a horror of losing these comfortable
and cost-free quarters, that aversion was as nothing beside the rabid
fury generated by his suddenly aroused suspicion. The mere thought of
what might be—when he allowed himself to project his imaginings on the
subject as far as that—threw him into a fit of murderous passion. He’d
keep his eyes open! He’d get on to it pretty damned quick if any funny
business was going on. And if it was —— ——

From that time and for more than a week it could have been noticed—and
probably was by Hulda—that Mr. Findlay went in to Boston with much
less frequency than formerly, and that when he did so he arrived back
at most unexpected times,—once coming in quite hurriedly by one of the
rear entrances fifteen minutes after he had left the house at the front
door, apparently departing for the day.

It so happened, though, that neither of the two people Findlay was
endeavoring to surprise in some sort of misdemeanor, was in the
slightest degree aware of his violent spasm of watchfulness. They were
both fighting desperately to struggle out of the torrent that had
swept them off their feet, and couldn’t be expected to take notice of
other things. Naturally, under the circumstances, Augustus discovered
nothing. There _was_ nothing. Even when they met alone, only a few
commonplace words, if any, passed between them. He never once overheard
the least thing that was out of the way when it happened that they were
alone together and he could manage to listen, and when they both went
out, as they did nearly every afternoon—Haworth for long walks on the
railroad track, Edith to trudge about the suburban roads or sometimes
to go in to Boston—and he followed one or the other of them, he never
found that they met anywhere or came within miles of meeting.

As he was unable to gather fuel for his jealousy, it began to burn
with diminished ferocity, and it wasn’t long before he revived his
briefly interrupted custom of returning late at night from his alleged
business trips to the city, bringing with him a heavy load of whatever
intoxicant he could buy with the money he borrowed from Haworth. For
a while, however, his subconscious department succeeded in keeping
uppermost in his mind the idea that it would be well to control himself
when he came in, and to get into bed as quietly as possible.

       *       *       *       *       *

Something over a fortnight after the revolver episode and the night
together by the open fire, the two unfortunates, caught in the
merciless grip of a love trap and struggling with all the strength
they could command to extricate themselves from it, had come very
close to reaching the limit of what they could do. Was anything else
to be expected? Completely out of their normal minds—mad—even quietly
delirious—living there together in the same house—left to themselves
most of the time, and trying to carry on as if they were casual
acquaintances—wouldn’t that wear out the strength of anyone, or, to be
more accurate, any two?

Haworth, one day along this time, came in from a tramp at dinner time
and learned from Hulda that Mr. Findlay hadn’t come in. He and Edith
would be alone together. It had happened several times lately, but
to-night he had the feeling that he couldn’t manage to behave as an
ordinary friend might; he didn’t think he could carry it through.

“When Mrs. Findlay comes down, ask her please to have dinner without
me. I’ve got some important work to do—very important.”

When Hulda went into the hall she saw Edith near the top of the stairs
and going up. She had come down and stopped near the door as she heard
Haworth speaking, and couldn’t help hearing what he said. Upon which
she fled up the stairs again, and a moment after the maid had caught
sight of her she was back in her room with the door closed.

Hulda followed and knocked softly.

“Can’t I bring you up something, Mrs. Findlay?”

“No, nothing—_please_.”

Hulda left a tray on Haworth’s drawing table, before which he was
sitting absently. But she knew, as soon as she saw him, that he
wouldn’t touch anything.

It was a wicked evening for them both. Haworth sat in a corner of his
workroom and stared before him, seeing nothing. Edith lay on her bed
with her head pushed in among the pillows.

With her it was simpler—just plain misery, and longing, and hunger and
thirst for him. But Haworth, while having all these feelings for her,
was at the same time feverishly hunting for some way out, all the while
knowing that nothing could be done without money, of which he was by
this time nearly destitute. If he had had the means at hand, there
isn’t the slightest doubt he’d have fled with her. But he hadn’t nearly
enough for that, nor had he anything on which he could raise it. The
amount that old Mr. Cripps had left to him (being probably the remains
of the money obtained on the mortgage) had virtually disappeared.

Haworth wasn’t in the habit of thinking of these things; he’d always
let them go until something happened. For himself what did it matter?
But now ... Edith. And he went over the problem again and again, hoping
each time to arrive at a better result.

It was very much later in the evening when Hulda came down and tapped
at his door. After she had knocked three times he heard her.

“Come in,” he said, huskily.

“Mrs. Findlay asked me to say could she speak to you for a minute.”

“Yes—yes.” Haworth roused himself and cleared his throat. “Tell her
I’ll go up there and—and see what she wants.”

“Yes sir.”

A moment later he knocked at Edith’s door and she opened it. They stood
silent. Suddenly he snatched both her hands and held them pressed
against him.

“Oh!” she breathed—a sort of whispered groan—and turned her head
away for God knows what—perhaps a last feeble effort to avert the
catastrophe she knew was coming. Soon she turned to him again and spoke
unsteadily, almost whispering.

“This was what I—what I wanted to tell you,” she said. “I’ve been
thinking it over, and now—you see—you see the way things are—I
can’t——Don’t you see I’ll have to go?”

“No!”

“Yes!”

“I couldn’t let you! How could I when I love you so!”

She was looking up in his face and her lips moved. Though no sound came
from them, he could feel what she was trying to say—knew it almost
before she began—and had her close in his arms, kissing her madly,
blindly, impetuously; whispering brokenly the few words of endearment
he knew.

It seemed hardly a moment, but it was in reality a large number of
them, before the violent closing of the front door recalled Edith
and Haworth to the surface of the earth. Not only were they made
acquainted by this with the circumstance of Findlay’s return, but the
demonstration following said closing gave a fairly reliable indication
of his condition, consisting as it did of a burst of song and a bit of
incoherent monologue.

“I’m going to lock you in,” Haworth whispered in Edith’s ear.

“Yes.”

He locked the door from the outside and put the key in his pocket. Then
he went along the corridor to the rear of the house, down the servants’
staircase, and through the passage into the main hall.

Augustus was preparing to negotiate the stairs.

“Well, how-dy-do!” he said, supporting himself by one of the newel
posts. “You see before you, Misser Haworth, a shinin’ ezample of the
pernishus influences of too mush happinish!”

Haworth stood silently regarding him.

“I’m shorry,” he went on. “Deeply an’ shincerely—e—sinsherely shorry.
But it was on account o’ shelibrashun! Yes, sir—shelibration! You’ll
be d’lighted to hear th’ glad tidings that I got a posishun. Yes,
sir—though I say it myself they took me on to-day at the Boshun Nalb’ny
freight yards. You know men are very scarce!”

“They must be,” said Haworth; and turning away he went into the living
room. From there he could hear Augustus finally accomplish the (for
him) considerable feat of ascending the stairs, and from the summit
of the same negotiate the short distance to his room. In a moment he
heard him come out again and walk heavily down the corridor to the room
occupied by Mrs. Findlay.

Haworth could hear his loud pounding on her door and boisterous demands
to be let in, together with the shouted information as to his having
been taken on by the railroad company and his urgent desire for further
celebration of that event. This he kept up interminably, varying it
with whining and begging that she open the door. But he eventually
became tired of it and went shambling back to his room.

Haworth gave him about half an hour. At the expiration of that time
he went upstairs and listened at his door. Loud breathing and raucous
nasal reverberations were the only sounds that could be heard from
within. The key was at his hand on the outside. He grasped it firmly so
there should be as little rattling as possible, and slowly turned it in
the lock. After listening a moment to make sure the slight click hadn’t
disturbed the sleeper within, he turned and walked down the corridor,
taking the other key out of his pocket as he went.

       *       *       *       *       *

It proved to be the truth that Augustus had got a job at the Exeter
Street freight yards. Whether to hustle boxes and barrels about or
sit on a high stool and work at bills of lading he never told. But
whatever it was, it obliged him to rise every morning at five-thirty
and have breakfast at six.

After three mornings of this, Alma, the cook, appeared before Haworth
and made the solemn declaration that she wouldn’t be staying there to
get up and cook a special breakfast “for the likes o’ him.” Haworth,
much disturbed, inquired of Hulda what he’d better do, and she told
him that the only way to settle it was to turn that Findlay man out of
the house and get rid of him “for good an’ all.” But of course if he
did that Augustus would take Edith with him. No way to prevent it that
he could see. He puzzled quite distractedly over the matter for some
time, and then bethought him of an old woman who came in from somewhere
once a week to clean. Mrs. Temple was her name, and several times in
the past when she’d been working in the basement he had called her into
his shop and got her to help him about something that needed an extra
pair of hands; and twice since Michael Cripps’s death—there being no
one else to do it—she had gone in to Boston to manage the matter of
replacing servants for him. It now occurred to him to ask her what had
better be done about Mr. Findlay’s new breakfast requirements.

Mrs. Temple was entirely equal to the occasion. She herself went to Mr.
Findlay and notified him in not the politest terms, that if he wanted
his breakfast before eight o’clock in the morning he’d have to get it
somewhere else. There was no more trouble; Findlay got his breakfast
somewhere else. And beginning about then Haworth came more and more to
rely on the old woman for advice and assistance. She was a wise one,
too, and had a perfectly clear idea of what she was about, which was
particularly fortunate just at this period, for the young inventor was
in a daze—a dream—an enchantment.

About this time the market where they bought provisions notified
Haworth that it could not extend further credit because of unpaid
bills. Following shortly, a grocery establishment did the same thing.
And Haworth, having no idea what to do about it, as it appeared on
investigation that he had very little money left—certainly not enough
to pay what was owing—turned the matter over to the old woman, asking
her please to attend to it in whatever way she thought best. This she
forthwith did by opening accounts elsewhere. This would carry them
along for a time at least, and after that “we’ll see.” Put that in
quotes, because it was Mrs. Temple’s philosophy to do what she could at
the time, and as to the future, “we’ll see.”

Where this old woman came from or when she came, no one seemed to
know. Haworth himself hadn’t the faintest idea. She spoke very seldom
and never about herself. Where she lived was also in the nature of a
mystery. Of course it could have been solved if anyone cared to follow
her, but no one did. And no one noticed it, either, when she began
coming in twice a week instead of once as formerly. Nobody had asked
her to, and she said nothing to anyone about an increase in wages.

       *       *       *       *       *

Haworth and Edith Findlay were now making little or no effort to
conceal the fact from Augustus—or for that matter from anyone—that they
were together for the greater part of the time. They were in every way
so utterly and completely taken up with each other that nothing else
appeared to them of the slightest consequence. They talked and read
together, and took long tramps in woods and fields and along country
roads.

Findlay usually got home from his work about half-past five or six,
often in plenty of time to see the two come in from an afternoon’s
tramp, or to find them working in the old flower garden together, or
something like that. And it was entirely open to observation—when
anyone was there to observe it—that in the evening they were by
themselves somewhere, reading together or engaged over chess or
cribbage.

While all this, as I’ve said, could be seen without effort, Augustus
had all the appearance of being unaware of it. But he had seen and
heard enough in the course of a week or so, to rouse his most malignant
passions. Without appearing to do so, he was watching every move they
made.

When he first began work at the yards, Findlay had felt too tired on
getting home at the end of the day, to go back to town again after
dinner—or even to nearer places—for alcoholic consolation. This
resulted in a much clearer mind than was normal with him. And once
his overpowering suspicion was awakened the thought of drinking never
crossed his mind.

As he became more and more aroused, at the same time gaining a stronger
perception of the situation and harboring a more desperate desire to
trap them, a scheme by which he could do so came into his mind, and he
set to work to put it into practice. The first move was his failure to
appear for dinner, which had not occurred since he got the job at the
freight yards. Late that night he came in loaded—or apparently so. One
would have supposed, if not too close an investigator, that the fellow
was in a hopeless state of intoxication. And so, notwithstanding that
his imitation of himself as a roistering inebriate was far from being
a perfect one, it succeeded with the two people for whose benefit (and
ultimate undoing) he was giving the performance; for, unfortunately,
neither of them was in the mood to criticize it. He was enabled,
therefore, eventually to stagger into his room with the impression
successfully conveyed that he was drunk and disorderly to the furthest
limit. Once there, and from the moment of his violently slamming shut
the door, his vigil began.

He had tools with which to open the door should anyone lock him in, and
the key was purposely left on the outside as a further blind. It was
the fourth time that he set this trap before it closed on its victims.

       *       *       *       *       *

Shortly before nine o’clock of the morning following the springing of
the trap, Mr. Augustus Findlay drove up to the front portico of the
mansion in a taxi, and with two small and exceedingly moderate-priced
trunks set in front beside the driver. He’d gone out early and bought
them at a place in Roslindale where they kept almost everything. The
chauffeur lent a hand in taking them into the house, and about an hour
later renewed the loan in bringing them out again.

Edith came slowly down the great stairway, pulling on her gloves. She
wore the long fur coat that Haworth had given her; indeed, everything
she had on came from him. She didn’t raise her eyes as she descended,
seeming to be occupied with her gloves. The veil which was pulled
down over her face failed to hide the paleness of it, which glimmered
through like a small white cloud.

Haworth was standing back against the wall near the foot of the stairs,
with the look of death upon him. It wasn’t so much the mortuary pallor
of his countenance as the strained fixity of his staring yet unseeing
eyes. He had gone to her room while Augustus was getting the taxi, and
found it locked.

“Open the door! Open it quick!” he’d called to her in a half whisper as
he knocked lightly, for to create a disturbance would defeat what he
had made up his mind to do.

“Oh, I can’t!” she answered, coming as near to him as possible. “He’s
taken away the key!”

Haworth turned and ran down the two flights of stairs to the basement,
and was back in a moment with a heavy iron bar.

“Darling, are you there?”

“Oh yes—I’m right here—as near as I can get!”

“Well, stand away—stand away from the door. I’m going to break it in!”

“No no!—Please don’t! Oh wait Michael!”

“Get back by the window! You’re coming with me!”

“Stop! Michael—stop! _You’ll hurt me!_ I’m close to the door—right
against it! Listen to me, dear—it’ll only make it worse! Yes, it
will—whatever you do! He could stop us. There’d be police and, oh!
reporters—and everything! I’m sure there would.”

Her low voice reached him clearly as she stood close against the door.

“What can we do?” he got out, hoarsely.

“Nothing now—nothing, dear, just now! I must go with him and you
mustn’t do anything! Afterward, when it all quiets down, we’ll find
some way!” This poor child was the wise and cool one through it all.
Haworth was demented with the hurt of it and his helplessness.

“Don’t let him find you here!” she went on. “Let him have his way.
Don’t say anything! Good-by, darling. I’ll be—I’ll be loving you
always—always—and oh, so much!”

Haworth tried to speak, but couldn’t. After a time he moved slowly away.

And now she was coming down the stairs, buttoning one of her gloves
and with her white face showing through the veil. He knew that she
passed close to him and felt the thrill of her nearness. Then came the
terrifying consciousness that she was going away from him. After that
she was gone.

Findlay, waiting outside, saw her seated in the taxi; then he entered
the house. Seeing Haworth near the stairway, he walked down the hall
and got out between his teeth with a peculiar low-voiced malevolence:
“You dirty loafer! You —— —— ——! Sometime—yes, by God! I’m going to get
even with you.” Having delivered himself of which, he strode through
the front door. A moment later the taxicab could be heard driving away.




PART V


For interminable weeks Haworth had no idea where they were. Edith had
asked him not to try to find her, and he would do nothing against her
wishes.

Most of the time he was sitting somewhere in the house—he didn’t notice
where—staring before him with wide open eyes that saw nothing. Hulda
brought him “just a taste” of this or that at meal times and he’d make
an attempt to eat a little so she wouldn’t feel hurt. Sometimes he
would start walking aimlessly about the house.

For quite a time he couldn’t bring himself to enter the room Edith had
occupied—his own room. But the time came when, with a fearful sinking
of the heart, he opened the door. After a while he ventured in a little
way and stood looking at the dressing table with the chair before it.
He could picture her there so well. His eyes slowly moved to other
things—the bureau, the chairs, the bed with the soft rug at the side
where her small white feet so often touched before she could find her
bedroom slippers.

Very soon—on his first visit—he had to turn away and hasten gropingly
out of the room. He was there again the next day, and on the floor of
the great wardrobe he found the worn little shoes that were on her feet
the day she came.

It was more than a fortnight after she left when he got a note from
her. It had been mailed. For a while he was unable to open it, as he
had been at first to enter her room. When he did, life came back to
him. Sometime they could meet somewhere—but not now. And he must not
try to find her. Would he please write and tell her if he still loved
her? It would help her to stay alive if she could only be sure that he
truly did. The best address would be the General Delivery, Boston. She
would read the letter and destroy it there at the Post Office.

After this he was able to look at all the things that spoke to him of
her, with painful delight instead of devastating despair.

But now financial troubles began to bear down on him. The greatly
increased expenses from having the Findlays there, together with
Augustus’s borrowings and Edith’s wardrobe, had more than made an end
of the few thousands left him by old Mr. Cripps. He had adopted the
plan long ago advised by Mr. Trescott, the attorney, of cutting down
living expenses and apportioning so much and no more to each month. In
this way the money could have been made to last nearly four years, and
surely by that time, Mr. Trescott had said, he ought to be able to do
something with his patents and mechanical work.

But this wise financial arrangement had been abandoned when the
Findlays came; and now the funds that were to have carried him for some
two years longer had entirely disappeared, and in addition to that a
number of people were clamoring for various amounts which he appeared
to owe them. Haworth turned in this emergency, as he had before, to
Mrs. Temple, who muttered something about “cormorants,” and then did
the best she could again, this time persuading some of the creditors
to wait a little on the ground that Mr. Haworth had valuable patents
and was on the point of selling one of them for thousands of dollars.
In cases where further credit was refused she made arrangements with
other (and more distant) firms. Of course there wasn’t the least use in
going to the electric-light company—nobody ever heard of their doing
anything except shut off the current—which they promptly did.

So far as light was concerned, Haworth minded it very little. The oil
lamps and candles Mrs. Temple got hold of somewhere, answered well
enough. But he did very much mind—though not so much at this time as
later, when he tried to get back to his work again—losing the power
for his machinery. He had only the haziest ideas as to creditors or
electrical calamities or where his groceries were or were not coming
from. Mrs. Temple was attending to it, and he let it rest at that. He
could live in peace with his dreams and memories and imaginings—all
of Edith and the exquisite pain of his longing for her. He wrote
to her and had another precious letter in reply. She told of their
having moved into a small house on Cherry Street, but said he must not
come there. Perhaps sometime, but not then. If they could only meet
somewhere, perhaps in town, before long, just for a few minutes. She
loved him so! And if she could not see him soon it did not seem as if
she could go on living.

It was a month after this before they finally met. He waited for
her on a quiet old street on the hill back of the State House. When
she finally came, neither could speak. They found a bench hidden by
shrubbery near the north end of the pond in the Public Garden.

After a time, when they had whispered those first words of endearment
after the long separation, and he could begin to realize things, he was
greatly disturbed by her appearance, so worn and thin she was, with a
hunted look in the eyes he loved beyond all measure. After much effort
he discovered in a roundabout way, that for one thing she was half
starved. It appeared that when Augustus earned anything he spent nearly
the whole of it on himself or gambled it away. Very little came to her
for household uses. Sometimes none. And now he wasn’t working at all.
He’d lost his place at the freight yards.

She wouldn’t mind so much about the food part of it, she said, but when
he came home late at night and there wasn’t anything to eat, he was so
violent! He seemed to think that she was to blame for it. The trouble
was he had a revolver again and flourished it about. He always seemed
to want to do that when he’d been drinking. And though she felt sure he
wouldn’t fire it, she couldn’t help being frightened.

After that, although they talked of other things in their brief time
together, he never once escaped from the terrifying realization that
she was starving,—actually starving, and he could do nothing. Until now
he had never entertained a suspicion of the tremendous importance of
having money. Even while they were there, with only those few precious
moments to themselves after weeks of loneliness, he was desperately
catching at straws of possibilities for obtaining some—in sufficient
amount, that is, to relieve her distressing situation at home. By a
lucky chance he had brought with him what little he had in the house,
so he could at least keep her from starvation for to-day. It would
hardly do more than that. But how to get more? How? How? How?

Then suddenly he thought of Mr. Trescott. He remembered one thing
the lawyer had recommended was the sale of the place. There was a
mortgage, but they could get a figure, he had said, that would cover it
and leave something over. Haworth couldn’t bring himself to do it then.
There was his shop and machinery and drafting room—all the things he
needed. But what did that amount to now? Edith had come into his life;
she _was_ his life. There was nothing else. He didn’t understand it,
but it was so—there was nothing else.

He would go and see Mr. Trescott the next day and ask him to sell
the place. That was settled. And for the rest of the time they were
together he had no thought but of Edith, and of her presence close
beside him. Most of it was spent in a restaurant, for as soon as
it would do after discovering the state of things he claimed to be
exceedingly hungry, and they went to one together. She was entirely
frank and said she was hungry too, and he had the joy of seeing her
present famishment relieved.

While they were there he told her, as a preparation for what would
come from selling the mansion (for she might not like that), that he
expected to dispose of one of his inventions and she was to go halves
with him on whatever he got. She said, “Oh!” and her eyes were alight
for a moment. But then she looked at him doubtfully.

“What is it, darling?” he asked.

“Oh—why, I’m thinking—I’m afraid you’ll not be taking care of
_yourself_—your machinery and patents and—and all that you need to do
about them.”

“There’ll be plenty for those things too.”

“Will there?”

And so at last she was satisfied, and they began to consider the way of
getting her “share” to her—whether a little at a time or a lump sum.
They finally decided on small and more frequent remittances, for if
Findlay once got the idea that she had a considerable amount of money
in the house he would resort to any violence to get it. And mailing
seemed the best way of sending, for she could go to the Post Office
without danger of discovery, if she was careful about it.

Soon after they had decided on this she left him, going out of the
restaurant by herself and getting a car in the subway which would take
her within a few blocks of Cherry Street.

       *       *       *       *       *

On reaching the mansion Haworth found a letter waiting for him. The
envelope bore the name of a prominent savings bank in Boston from which
he vaguely remembered having heard before. Within was a formal notice
to the effect that if the interest on the mortgage note was not paid
by such and such a time (which was only five days away), foreclosure
proceedings would at once be instituted. This explained why the name
of the bank had seemed familiar, other communications on the same
subject having come in before, though none so definite and alarming.
These—as he had no idea what to do with them—he had turned over, with
other bills and requests for payment, to Mrs. Temple; and although
this estimable old woman quite well understood grocery and market
accounts, foreclosure notices were as Greek to her. She had therefore
done nothing about them, quite certain that this behavior would bring
further explanation if there was any.

It looked serious to Haworth. If they foreclosed he wouldn’t be able
to sell the place. Naturally he wasn’t able to sleep that night. Next
morning he went to Mr. Trescott’s office.

The old lawyer said at once that he doubted if anything could be done,
as the property was mortgaged to nearly the limit. A forced sale was
out of the question. When he had advised selling some years before,
prices were high; now they were normal again. A second mortgage would
hardly be possible under the circumstances. The only chance he saw
was the possibility that the holders of the first would be willing to
make a new one for an increased amount, or that a new one for a larger
amount could be negotiated elsewhere and the old one paid off with the
proceeds, leaving him something after the transaction. He would take
the matter up with the bank, and Mr. Haworth would hear from him in a
day or two. He inquired how the inventions were selling and was sorry
to hear that they hadn’t done better. He had sent a few people out
there to see them and would try to do so again.

       *       *       *       *       *

Four days later—four terrible days for Haworth—the letter he was
waiting for came. Mr. Trescott requested him to call and attend to the
execution of a new mortgage. It seemed the bank was willing to increase
the amount of the loan to the extent of five thousand dollars—a
consideration being, however, not alone the payment out of this of
interest due, but interest on the new note for two years in advance.

Haworth, enormously relieved, went to the Trescott & Chamberlain
offices and the business was transacted. Fifty dollars was at once
mailed to Edith, and he sent her that amount weekly thereafter. Mrs.
Temple was given what was necessary to pay current bills and, at
her suggestion, the expenses of the establishment were reduced still
further.

All thought of attention to the needs of the house, in the way of
repairs, painting, and the like, was abandoned, as was also the keeping
up of the grounds and gardens surrounding it. Even the shattered
window in front on the second floor was still as Augustus’s hurtling
revolver had left it. These various economies and others wouldn’t have
occurred to Haworth, but his overwhelming desire to save enough out of
the additional mortgage money to enable him to take Edith away, caused
him to entreat Mrs. Temple to think of all possible ways to cut down
expenditures. This she did.

In the course of the next few weeks Edith’s condition was much
improved, though it couldn’t be said that she looked entirely well.
The two met in town when they could—which wasn’t often, for Augustus,
being out of a job, was hanging about. They’d thought of Franklin Park
and other places nearer than the Public Garden, but Edith couldn’t lose
herself before going to them as she could in the crowds in the city
district. Besides this, she had managed to find a place where they’d
give her needlework to take home—one of the “sweating” industries you
read about—and this not only furnished her with an excuse for going to
town occasionally, but had so far blocked Findlay’s suspicions as to
where her housekeeping money came from.

Several times they went out Cambridge way and beyond to some woodsy
place, and wandered among the trees. There were still warm Indian
summer days for them, though November was close at hand.

It was on one of these trips, as they were sitting on soft green moss
with their backs to the trunk of a great oak, that Haworth told her
about going away—that he couldn’t live without her. They would take a
steamer to South America or anywhere she wished. There would be money
enough to pay the fares and keep them until he could find work. He
would dig in the streets or do anything, it made no difference what, if
he could only be with her.

She looked at him in a half-frightened way and shook her head a little.

“You—you don’t mean——I thought you’d come!” he said.

“There’s a—there’s something——” She couldn’t go on and her face went
white.

He looked at her silently, desolated by the thought that she didn’t
care enough for him to come. Finally he half whispered:

“I suppose you——You don’t love me—_really_.”

“There’s only you in the world, Michael—only you—_now_—but before
long....”

He looked at her for the rest.

“Before long there’ll be some one else.”

It was a moment before he understood.

       *       *       *       *       *

As weeks went by Haworth’s anxieties about Edith came to be
unbearable—the thought of her having to live in that comfortless
shanty and being subjected, at such a time, to the brutalities of her
liquor-crazed husband. Finally, in desperation, he went to Mr. Trescott
for advice, explaining that the Findlays were relatives of old Cripps
and that he (Haworth) had taken them in at the mansion for a while,
though they were now in a house of their own; that Mr. Findlay was
brutal and loathsome in every respect, often drinking to excess and at
such times abusing and browbeating his wife and frequently terrorizing
her with a revolver; so that, now she was to be confined, he feared
she’d not only have no care, but be seriously injured in some way.

“I suppose it wouldn’t do for her to have the trouble and anxiety of
divorcing him—now?”

“I—I’m afraid not.”

“Can’t she go home to her mother or family?”

“No.” (Shaking his head). “She hasn’t any.”

“Alone in the world, eh?”

“Not so good as that. She’s with him.”

“I see.... Treats her badly, you say?”

“I don’t think that’s quite the word for it.”

“You said something about a revolver?”

Haworth nodded in affirmation.

“That he threatened her with it?”

“Yes.”

“Did anyone see him do that?”

The young man hesitated for an instant; then, “I did—once.”

“Then this threatening with a revolver took place in your presence?”

“Yes.”

“Did you interfere in any way?”

“Yes; I took it away from him.”

Mr. Trescott regarded Haworth with peculiar interest for an instant.
Finally he said: “If the fellow’s slamming around, threatening his wife
with firearms, we can get the patrolman on that beat to keep an eye on
him. Write the address for me.”

“But it’s no place for her there, where he might come in crazy drunk
any minute. Isn’t there some way so she can be kept away from him—so he
can’t get to her?”

“I’m afraid not, Mr. Haworth, unless he——” Mr. Trescott broke off as a
possibility occurred to him. “Has he any money?” he asked. “Enough, I
mean, to have her well taken care of—private hospital and all that?”

“Yes.”

“Oh, he _has_! Well, do you think there’s any way to make him do it?
It’s going to cost something, you know.”

“He’ll do it.”

“That’s the thing, then.”

Trescott wrote an address on a desk pad and scribbled a few words
below. “See the doctor personally. Tell his secretary it’s from me.” He
handed the address to Haworth. “He’ll see that she’s sent to the right
place. And I rather think they can let her come along awhile before.
She’ll have nurses, doctors, everything, and nobody’ll be allowed to
see her that might have the least unfavorable effect—you understand. As
I say, it’s going to be rather expensive. You feel quite positive the
fellow can stand it?” He was watching the young man narrowly as he put
the question.

“Yes.”

“All right then—Now, Mr. Haworth, what about you? I suppose, from what
you’ve been telling me, that you’ve had some—er—interruptions and—and
anxieties that may have seriously interfered with your work?”

“Yes, I have.”

“Well, we’ve got one distraction out of the way,” Trescott said,
hopefully, indicating the note and address that Haworth was holding in
his hand.

“Yes,” the young man said; and after thanking Mr. Trescott in his
laconic way, he went to the address of the doctor.

       *       *       *       *       *

They kept Edith at the hospital for some weeks after she could have
gone home. For observation, it was said—but that didn’t get to Haworth.
He knew only that all had gone well, that there was a very minute
daughter in the world, and that the conditions might perhaps be better
than they had been so far as Findlay was concerned, for a warning from
the patrolman given before his wife was taken to the hospital had
apparently accomplished its purpose. Augustus entertained a serious
repugnance to jail from having once been compelled to sample it, and
the patrolman’s words were seed sown in specially fertilized soil.

For some time he had kept on the safe side of the line which divided
bestial drunkenness from mere gentlemanly intoxication. And when Edith,
after an absence of some two months, returned to the cottage on Cherry
Street with the baby and a nurse, the comparative decency of his
conduct came near astounding her. Findlay, however, was controlling
himself with the utmost difficulty. To the fear of the police was now
added the presence of a nurse—and in a damned uniform, at that! How
did he know but that she was sent there to report him? His mania to
get even with Haworth increased till he was in a condition of chronic
fury. He’d found out that Haworth had been meeting his wife, that the
money she’d been using for household expenses came from him instead
of being earned by her, that he had sent her to the hospital for her
confinement and paid for it—though as to that, who should pay for it if
not he?—and he hadn’t a doubt that it was Haworth who’d set the police
on him. Haworth—Haworth—Haworth—whichever way he turned. And here she
was, still wearing the clothes this fellow had given her—brazenly
wearing them before his face! The getting of his money was nothing; it
was what it meant—what it showed was going on.

He’d been told by some of his disreputable associates that he could
bring suit for alienation and get all the rotter’s property away
from him. He’d do it, too! He knew a lawyer who’d take it on spec.
Cost nothing. But that wasn’t enough. Money was all very well, but
satisfaction—that was what he wanted—satisfaction!

       *       *       *       *       *

Haworth had been allowed to see Edith a few days after the child was
born. She was very white and beautiful. When the nurse brought the
little speck of humanity, sound asleep, and laid it beside her, he sat
gazing at it for a long time. Edith lay looking at him with a shadow of
a smile flitting about her face. Soon the nurse made a little sign and
turned away. Haworth bent over and pressed his lips to Edith’s hands
as they lay on the coverlet—first one and then the other, and then the
first again and then the other again. Then he looked once more at the
little one, and finally let his eyes meet Edith’s in a long embracing
look that told her everything. After that he rose and tiptoed out of
the room. Neither of them noticed that not a word had been said. They
had spoken in a language not crippled by words.

I’ve always had the idea that those innocent and delightful people who
are born without a trace of what might be referred to as economics, and
who are unable to acquire enough of same for personal use, should have
financial guardians appointed to help them through. Charles Michael
Haworth, the inventor, should have had one.

Everything that he could lay his hands on was expended in providing the
best possible care for Edith during the period of her maternity. No
still small voice—indeed, no voice of any description—was heard by him
in warning against overdoing in the matter of present expenditure, as
future needs were likely to be still greater.

Haworth could not think of such things. He could think only of Edith.
And not Edith in the future, but Edith now. One day, upon roughly
figuring from his check-book stubs (which was the only figuring he ever
did) he was amazed to find that he had very nearly expended the entire
amount deposited from the new loan. Only a few hundred left, and he
needed that for the nurse who was taking care of Edith! The doctor had
advised keeping some one with her for a while, as she was still far
from well.

After a tough night worrying about it, he got old Mrs. Temple in and
told her that he had come to the place where there was no more money
for his own use—none at all. All the servants must go—the cook and
Hulda, even herself, for he would be unable to pay any more wages. He
was sorry, but they must all go.

“What will you do, sir?” the old woman asked.

“Oh, that’s—that’s nothing. I’ll be all right.”

“You won’t be all right without your food, Mr. Haworth.”

“I can get it somewhere.” He had vague notions of things in tins and
oatmeal and baked beans, that he could live on for a few cents a day.
That money in the bank, every dollar of it, must go for the nurse—for
the nurse and their food, too. Augustus was doing nothing.

Mrs. Temple went out in a blind sort of way. Soon Hulda appeared.

“She told me, sir.” She came just within the door, embarrassed.

“Oh yes—about going. I’m sorry.”

“I—I’d rather stay, Mr. Haworth.”

“You mustn’t.”

“If you please, it’s nothing to me about the paying—not till you can.”

“I don’t see how I ever can, Hulda. And there won’t be anything for you
to eat—nothing you’d like at all. It’s too bad, isn’t it? You’ve been
so good to me, Hulda.”

A strange convulsion twitched the honest Swedish face and a couple of
large-sized tears went sliding down her cheeks, upon realizing which,
she bolted out of the room.

Haworth went down into the shop. Not to work; that was
impossible—impossible even if the power current hadn’t been shut off.
He stood for half an hour gazing vacantly down the long room with the
lathes and heavier machines lined along one side, the dead power shaft
above them, and the bench with vises and tool racks and the lighter
machines along the other.

Hulda and the cook left four days later, the former making spasmodic
swipes across the upper part of her face with a bunched-up handkerchief
as she stood near the taxi waiting for them to bring down her trunks.
Nothing, however, would induce old Mrs. Temple to budge. Haworth’s
earnest pleading (on her behalf) that not only would he have no money
for her wages, but nothing wherewith to buy food for her, made no
impression on the old woman. She announced that she was a-goin’ to come
in an’ see to him an’ he might just as well make up his mind to it.
Wages wasn’t no consequence; he could pay her later when he was doin’
well with his inventions. A compromise was finally reached. She was to
come in once in a while to put things to rights, but you may as well
know now that the said “once in a while” eventually developed into
twice in a while and then to three times a week; later still, as you
will see, to the old woman remaining in the house night and day as long
as she was able to manage it.

Three months had passed since the baby was born, and Edith hadn’t
regained her strength. It was absolutely necessary that she should
have proper care and nourishment. The doctor continued to visit her at
intervals and insisted on the importance of having the nurse remain
with her. So far Haworth had been able to manage these things, but he
was now close upon the end of his resources, and as time went on his
anxiety became appalling.

He had been to a number of machine shops and manufacturing
establishments and applied for work. At two places he got a chance to
try, but in neither did he last more than three days. It wasn’t the
trouble of earlier years—inability to hold his mind concentrated on
work that was deadly and meaningless repetition. With the tremendous
incentive he had and the absence of interfering inventive ideas, he
could have done it. But with his marvelous mechanical knowledge he
couldn’t compete in cheap rapidity with a boob they might pick up in
the street. What he did he must do carefully and well. That lifelong
habit was absolutely unbreakable, and it unfitted him for modern work.
It took time. That wouldn’t do.

It came to be the day after to-morrow that he was expected to pay the
monthly expenses for Edith, and he realized that he couldn’t do it.
Mrs. Temple saw from the way he strode blindly about the house that he
was in distress. She’d been watching him (without seeming to do so)
for some hours. Finally she managed to get in his way so that he was
compelled to stop before her. He hesitated and looked at her blankly.

“Oh, Mrs. Temple. Yes—yes.”

“I was just thinkin’, Mr. Haworth, there’s furniture in this house that
you ain’t got any use fur that I c’n see.”

“Take anything you want, Mrs. Temple.” He turned to resume his feverish
pacing.

“No, Mr. Haworth, it wasn’t that!” She was so emphatic that he stopped
again and stood looking at her.

“There’s good furniture here, Mr. Haworth. Now that sideboard—I don’t
see’s you really need it. Maybe I could find somebody that’d give a
good price for it——”

“What?”

She repeated what she’d said.

“Could you find him now?”

“I’ll have to go in to Boston. There’s a man there——”

“Would—would it be enough to—to——”

“I dunno exactly, but that sideboard’s wuth consid’rable; and that
walnut set in the East Room——”

“Anything—anything, Mrs. Temple. Please hurry. You might lose a
chance!” And he almost pushed her out of the room. The enormous relief
made him feel really faint and he sank into the nearest chair.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was more than two months after the sale of the sideboard—during
which interval many other articles of furniture and four paintings
had been disposed of in one way or another, together with the largest
of his two lathes and his shaper and drill press—that Edith heard
what was going on. The information reached her via Augustus, who kept
a close watch on Haworth, and observing the trucks of second-hand
dealers taking these various articles from the mansion, took delight in
taunting her with it.

At once she insisted that the nurse should not remain another day—that
it was entirely unnecessary, as she was feeling very much better. She
seemed so determined about this that the doctor thought best to give
way, and told her the nurse could go at the end of the month.

In a letter to Haworth, Edith told him that she was so much better that
the nurse was going, and that hereafter she could manage with very
little help—perhaps none at all—as Augustus had got a job again and she
was going to insist that he turn over half his pay to her for household
expenses. She would miss the nurse, of course, she said, especially
about getting his letters at the Post Office and taking hers there. But
she would find some way.

This letter reached Haworth at a time when he was beginning again to be
frightfully anxious as to where he could obtain money to go on with,
for he had only a small amount left and everything they could find in
the house that would sell had been disposed of. He was cutting off
every possible expense, even to half starving himself, pretending to
Mrs. Temple, when she came in on one of her “on” days and wanted to
cook things for him, that he had just eaten a hearty meal and couldn’t
possibly get down any more. He had an empty baked-bean can that he
feloniously left where she would see it, in order to help with the
deception.

Edith’s letter gave him relief. He sat on his bench in the workroom,
thinking it over, and before going to bed he wrote one to her asking if
he couldn’t call and see her before the nurse actually left as it was
better for him to come while she was there. And so it was arranged.

And the nurse was discreet and left them to themselves. And he held the
minute bundle of recently arrived humanity in his arms a few moments
until it protested vigorously on account of his profound awkwardness.
An exquisite hour it was for both of them. But Augustus was informed
of what had occurred by the small boy he’d hired to keep a lookout,
and on reaching home that evening was so violent and abusive that the
nurse started out of the house to bring the police, but he called her
back, thereafter subsiding into a scowling silence, and not long after
leaving the house.

       *       *       *       *       *

On the following day, along toward afternoon, a car came up the drive
and the front-door buzzer sounded. Haworth opened the door to the
physician in whose care Edith had been at the hospital and who’d been
keeping an eye on her since she came back to the Cherry Street cottage.

“Mr. Haworth, good afternoon.”

“Oh—the doctor, isn’t it?”

“Yes, Markham. Met you two or three times at the hospital. Dropped
around to have a little talk.”

Haworth stood, near to being paralyzed with a frightful dread—some
sort of premonition concerning Edith—that stopped his heart.

He was aroused by the doctor’s gently turning him about and walking
with him into the house. There was no furniture left in the vast dim
hall, and Doctor Markham, seeing through the open door on the left that
the room beyond had at least chairs and a table in it, guided him in
there. Haworth managed to make a motion toward one of the chairs and
Doctor Markham seated himself. Then Haworth slowly sat down, without
once taking his eyes off the doctor. He heard a voice saying something
about there being no cause for alarm and wishing to assure somebody
that there was nothing that couldn’t be taken care of if the proper
steps were taken without delay.

“We’ve had Mrs. Findlay under observation for some little time,” Doctor
Markham went on. “I needn’t tell you that the important thing in these
cases is to get them in time; and while there was no——”

“What cases?” broke in Haworth, who was on the rack.

“The situation is this, Mr. Haworth: During the time Mrs. Findlay
was at the hospital we deemed it inadvisable to make a thorough
examination, for she could hardly have failed to realize what we were
looking for, and the effect on her might have been unfortunate. But we
feared a tendency toward tubercular trouble. We could say nothing more
at the time.”

The doctor paused.

Haworth heard himself repeating huskily, “At that time.”

“Yes.”

“But you—you can now?”

“We’ve made an examination, Mr. Haworth.”

Doctor Markham waited a moment and then continued: “Fortunately the
infection is very slight—only a small tract at the top of the left
lung. We’re in plenty of time, you see, and by sending her to the
right locality and making sure that she has proper treatment and
surroundings, there’s no occasion for anxiety. I came to see you about
this because I don’t know of anyone else. Her husband is out of the
question. Perhaps you know of some relatives or—or——”

Haworth shook his head a little and tried to say “no,” but accomplished
no more than a movement of his lips.

“The only thing, then, is to leave it in your hands, Mr.
Haworth,” the doctor went on, “and I’m very much hoping you’ll
see your way—or—or find a way” (he could not help a glance about
the poverty-stricken room) “to send her to one of the best
high-altitude cures, where she’ll have a complete change in every
respect:—air—food—sunlight—surroundings—even language if possible, for
every little helps. Attitude of mind is an important element you know.
Of course there are State and other institutions here—all admirable in
their way. But I’m sure Mrs. Findlay needs something more than we can
find near at hand. Moreover, there’s a child to be considered. That
complicates matters a little.”

Haworth sat rigid, his eyes fixed on the physician.

“I’m going over the case carefully with Doctor Benjamin, our lung
specialist, and I’ll have you fully informed of the steps to be taken.
Mrs. Findlay is aware of her condition. Just as well, too. She’d have
to know very soon in order to understand why certain things in the way
of treatment are necessary.” Doctor Markham understood the situation
pretty well and felt no resentment nor, indeed, surprise that Haworth
failed to rise from his chair or even seemingly to be aware that he was
going. He left the young man sitting motionless, staring before him.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mrs. Temple came in next morning and found Haworth in the room on the
left, sitting motionless, staring before him. He had the appearance of
having been there for some time, though she had no idea it was so long
as since the day before. For that matter, neither had he.

It wasn’t necessary to make an effort to rouse him; he looked up at
her as she came near and answered her “good morning” absently. Later
he took a cup of strong coffee she brought, and drank it in compliance
with her request. Afterward she heard him murmuring faintly and
mechanically, as from force of habit, that he had had all the breakfast
he wanted and really couldn’t eat any more, so would she please not get
it for him. She paid no attention to this, though, and cooked him an
egg with two little ribbons of bacon which she had brought over from
her own limited base of supplies. When she set the tray on a kitchen
chair by his side he looked up at her gratefully but shook his head a
little. But when she said, “Please eat it, Mr. Haworth,” he did so.
Afterward, when she had gone back to the kitchen and was washing the
dishes he came out and asked if she could take a note to Mrs. Findlay
for him and bring back an answer. He explained how to get there, and
she started at once, without waiting to finish the dishes. There was a
strange and disquieting look in his eyes that she hadn’t seen in them
before.

He had scribbled in pencil, “I must see you—I must—I must.” And the
answer came back, “Darling—oh, my darling, please don’t be worried—it
will be all right. Come to-morrow—three is the best time.”

       *       *       *       *       *

When he was with her once more and she with him, there wasn’t much
that could be said. It was mostly the two silent ones clinging to each
other, feeling even then that the dread specter was standing over them,
making ready to tear them eternally apart; yet each managed to find a
few words of encouragement, Edith stopping his eyes with kisses when
they turned that terrified look on her, and telling him there wasn’t
any danger at all—that she felt so perfectly well; he muttering about
a patent he might sell, and anyway there were other things he had in
mind, so that she’d have every care and be sent to a place where cure
was certain.

And then there was the little one—Mildred they were going to name
her—sound asleep on the nearby couch! It was inconceivable that tragedy
could come to such an innocent! He sat for a long time looking down at
the child, with Edith’s hand, now so white and thin, pressed against
his lips.

While he was there the maddening inability to do what would save her
seemed not to burn into him so mercilessly. It was when he left her
and was back in the vast and gloomy house with its shadowy candlelight
and bareness of furniture that these things returned upon him and
assaulted him with their full force. And something that made it still
more terrible was lying on the table in the living room, awaiting his
return—the large envelope from Doctor Markham’s office containing
the specialist’s report. An agonizing thing to read, yet he did not
hesitate.

Mrs. Findlay was in a serious condition. Though much of the detail was
beyond his comprehension, he had no difficulty in understanding that.
No time must be lost in getting her to one of the high-altitude cures.
Switzerland was recommended as most desirable for one of her type.
There were several that were held to be as beneficial in the United
States, but for Mrs. Findlay they were not to be preferred if it were
possible to send her abroad.

Haworth saw it all. To save her life she must be sent to one of those
places—and little Mildred taken care of. And there was no one but
himself to do it,—no one.

Mrs. Temple, pretending to be busy with an unusual amount of cleaning,
managed to hover near, not annoying him as he sat distracted or moved
blindly about the house, but ready at any time to do what she could—for
she saw there was serious trouble. Along toward seven o’clock she
made tea and cooked a small chop she’d bought while he was away. When
she asked him to come and have his supper, he stared at her vacantly,
seeming not to know what she meant; but it came to him after a little,
and he seated himself at the table in the small breakfast room without
further urging, drinking and eating, but plainly without an idea of
what he was doing.

Afterward he wandered back into the living room, behaving somewhat as
people probably do when they’re walking in their sleep—I never saw one.

The old woman glanced in occasionally while doing the dishes, and saw
each time that he was sitting there staring into vacancy, the pallor of
his face emphasizing the darkness of his deep-set eyes. She was greatly
worried, and wasn’t going home _that_ night, no matter what! He might
be taken ill or something. She would lie down on the old lounge she’d
found in the loft of the barn and brought into the kitchen when all
the good furniture was taken away. The last thing before doing this
she stole quietly to the door and looked in again. Mr. Haworth hadn’t
moved from the chair nor changed his position in any way. She went back
to the kitchen and stretched herself on the ancient and moth-eaten
sofa. It was a warm evening and she needed no covering. It seemed only
a few moments after she fell asleep that she was suddenly awakened by
the sound of violent knocking or pounding that apparently came from
somewhere in the basement. She listened for a few seconds, alarmed, her
old heart doing a corresponding pounding of its own. Haworth hadn’t
worked down there for months, and it seemed incredible that he would
suddenly go at it again at such an hour, and with the terrible thing,
whatever it was, that seemed to be pressing on his mind.

But Mrs. Temple was game, if ever a woman was. It was hardly two ticks
after the pounding began before she was feeling her way down the
basement stairs.

It was Haworth at work, and not in his shop, but some distance beyond
it. She could see him by the light of the lamp he’d placed near. He
had a lot of weather-beaten boards or planks that had apparently been
dragged in through one of the basement windows. She couldn’t think
where he’d got them, unless it was from the old barn at the rear of
the house. Out of these he was building a partition, so far as the old
woman could make out, and he was evidently in a fever of haste about
it, knocking and clawing out old nails, sawing boards in lengths, and
then nailing them to upright timbers or studding set in a way so they
would wall off a small-sized room.

Even Haworth’s furious activity which she now beheld, seemed better to
her than having him sit rigid, staring at nothing, with some hidden
anguish eating his heart out; and she thought best not to disturb him.
So, after watching him a few moments she turned away and went back up
the stairs, and as soon as she’d got herself quieted a little, lay down
again on the old lounge. But not to sleep. She didn’t expect that. How
could she while hearing this dearly beloved young man in his frenzied
fit of work, to which he was driven by some desperation the cause of
which she could not guess?

It was still going on when the morning sunlight struck in through one
of the windows, and did not cease until she went down to him with
coffee and toast on a tray. He stopped when she spoke, and stood an
instant looking at her. Then he thanked her, but really he didn’t want
anything. This behavior she considered much nearer to what was normal
with him than the way he’d acted at supper the night before—eating
everything without a word. Indeed, Mrs. Temple was so much encouraged
by his refusal to take anything, that she went further and insisted. He
must take it now while it was hot, and she set the tray on the plank he
was just then sawing. On this the young fellow came to terms and drank
the coffee and ate the toast—very hurriedly to be sure, and with eyes
roving about the structure he was engaged upon; but he “got it down,”
as Mrs. Temple said to herself, “and that’s the main thing!”

In three or four minutes he was working again, and with the same
feverish haste—the same madness to have it finished.

It was late the previous night that the thing had occurred to him.
He’d been sitting where Mrs. Temple last saw him, all hope gone,
crushed, stunned, overcome. All at once, without warning, he found
himself standing erect and with a plan or conception in his mind
which promised, on its first occurring to him, to be something which
would certainly turn defeat into victory. The central idea of the
thing, with its most extraordinary possibilities for profit, came to
him as a whole, and from that he began rapidly to develop it. For
nearly an hour he stood there intensely occupied with this, feeling
positive that he had something which would enable him to save the
life of the one so dear to him. Toward the end of that time the vital
necessity for secrecy began to dawn on him and then to rise rapidly
into tremendous importance, until he suddenly came to the realization
that it was at the basis of everything—that without it the invention
would be valueless—so much junk. He decided at once to build a room
in the basement where the device could be constructed without the
slightest danger that knowledge of its purpose or mechanism would leak
out. Bars and padlocks. Timbers from the old barn back of the house.
Almost before he knew what he was doing he found himself out there with
hammer and chisel and cross-cut saw. He took the lamp that Mrs. Temple
had left lighted on the table, and drove at the business frantically.
Time—time—time! The doctors said delay might turn the scales against
her.

In a couple of hours he had enough timber ripped off and dragged to the
basement to begin on, and at it he went, startling Mrs. Temple—of whose
presence in the house he was unaware—out of a sound sleep.

Working with the same desperate drive all the next day and well into
the succeeding night, he had the small room entirely planked-up by two
in the morning, the partitions build up solid to the floor joists of
the room above.

He was at it again the morning following, and Mrs. Temple knew from the
muffling of the sound, as she heard it in the kitchen, that he had now
closed himself into the new room and was working inside.

There isn’t a doubt in the world that Charles Michael Haworth would
have starved himself to death at this time but for Mrs. Temple. Without
a word of remonstrance or fault-finding she simply took things as
they came and hustled about to do what she could. Sometimes she was
able to induce a grocer or market man to give a little more credit.
Failing that, she’d go home to her lodgings (a small room in a tenement
building of forbidding aspect) and pull a battered old trunk from under
the bed. After looking about to satisfy herself that no spectators were
present, she’d reach in under the clothing which partly filled it, and
bring up a cigar box, from which the old woman would surreptitiously
and with a snatching motion, take out a dollar or two, quite in the
manner of one engaged in a robbery of some kind. Very well she knew
that this little hoard had been put by for a rainy day, and nearly
always she’d mumble to herself, “Well if this ain’t one, what is it I’d
like to know!” as she pilfered it. The money was quickly exchanged for
groceries.

She brought his food to him in the basement, putting the dishes on an
upturned barrel near the little room where he was working. Then she’d
call to him that it was there and at once hurry away upstairs again.
He wouldn’t open the door while she was in the basement. For sleep
he took what little he got like a Chinese laundryman, dropping down
where he was when exhausted and resuming his hectic labor the instant
consciousness returned.

There was only one outside interruption during the time Haworth was
driving to finish the apparatus or device he was working on, and that
a brief one. Two young men came to the house one morning, and so
impressed old Mrs. Temple (who answered the bell) with the importance
of their errand—assuring her that instead of being after money they
wanted to pay Mr. Haworth some—that she went down and talked to him
through the partition about it. It resulted in his finally putting on
his coat and going up to see what they wanted. He found them on the
front portico. Although Mrs. Temple had asked them in, they seemed, for
some reason, to prefer waiting outside.

Certainly the one who did the talking did it well. He was a reporter
from one of the Boston papers and had in view a story for the Sunday
supplement. This recluse inventor had become quite a subject of remark
in his near neighborhood, and something of general interest might
be got out of it. Realizing from what he’d heard that Haworth would
be a ticklish proposition to handle, he said nothing about the real
object of his visit, but pretended instead that he wanted to buy one
of his inventions. His talk was so earnest, so glib, so voluble, that
Haworth was led into answering quite a lot of questions about his
life, habits of work, etc., before he realized what he was doing, and
altogether failed to notice that during this time the other chap (who
was a photographer) was dodging about in different places, carrying a
peculiar box-like affair in his hands. It was this latter that brought
an abrupt end to the interview, for Haworth’s ear, trained to a hair
on mechanical sounds, suddenly caught the click of a camera, and
turning on the instant, he got a fleeting glimpse of the thing focused
on him before the young man had time to drop it down. After a second’s
pause he turned on his heel and went into the house, closing the
door firmly, though not violently, behind him. The reporter chap was
disappointed, as he had it laid out to see the inside and look over the
inventions after they had the photographs taken. But with the pictures
they had there was enough stuff to go on with, and he could do a bit of
imaginary work for the interior.

Three weeks—even working under forced draft as he did—was quick time
in which to finish what Haworth had undertaken. He had one thing in
his favor, though, which counted for not a little: the parts he had
to get out were large and simple—heavy wooden shafts and levers,
smooth-running pulleys with cords and weights, a great heavy pendulum
with escapement device—parts like that, and all on a scale involving no
complicated adjustments. Whatever lathe-work was necessary he managed
on the small lathe—it was only the large one that had been sold. He had
to rig it for foot power, but that was a comparatively simple matter.

On an evening which was near to the end of this period of drastic
toil, Haworth sent Mrs. Temple on an errand so that he could test his
mechanism out. He found that with some minor changes and readjustments
that took him, notwithstanding the furious drive he put into it, a day
and a half longer, the device operated with certainty and precision.
Mad to complete it as he was, he realized that it must be unerring in
its performance. The slightest thing amiss or out of adjustment would
not only have spelled disaster, but pronounced it.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was late one afternoon when Haworth was finally able to say to
himself that the mechanism was complete and its operation satisfactory.
As early the next morning as he thought likely people would have
arrived in their offices or places of business, he started out to
find some one who would purchase the rights for the handling and
exploitation of his novel mechanical conception; and before evening
of that same day he had come home stunned and stricken with the
realization that all his work had been of no avail. For it had never
occurred to the young inventor that the absolute secrecy upon which
the value of his device depended, could at the same time prove an
insurmountable obstacle in the way of disposing of it. Not until he
went out and tried to make a sale did this unfortunate situation reveal
itself. Then, and at once, he made the terrifying discovery that he
couldn’t possibly describe his mechanism and its tremendous monetary
possibilities until he was perfectly certain that he was doing so
to the man who would buy it; for there could be no possibility of
anyone taking hold of it and agreeing to pay the large sum of money
that he (Haworth) must have, as well as assuming the heavy expense of
manufacture and general promoting, unless given a full description of
the invention and its operation, together with his plans connected with
its exploitation. If ever there was a vicious circle on earth, this was
one—and not much distance to go in circumnavigating it.

The truth came to him with a shock; indeed, he got the shock before his
conscious mind was aware of the truth. He had gone to a man he used
occasionally to meet at the mansion while old Mr. Cripps was alive.
This gentleman and Mr. Cripps seemed quite friendly, and the latter
once mentioned that Mr. Hollister (the gentleman’s name) had just made
a big pile of money on some patent he owned. Haworth hadn’t seen him
since those days. His office was in a large building on Beacon Street
a little way up from Tremont, and Haworth was there before ten in the
morning. It was his first attempt to sell.

Mr. Hollister received him graciously—an elderly gentleman with a sharp
Yankee face, though kindly at that. While he was quite disturbed by
Haworth’s appearance—his extreme emaciation and ghastly pale face with
the feverish fire burning in his eyes—he showed no sign of it, and
after making him sit down by his desk and remarking on the number of
years since they’d met, asked if there was anything he could do for him.

Haworth began at once to explain that he’d just perfected a mechanical
novelty regarding which he would like to interest him. He had built,
in the basement of the house, a full-sized working model—in fact, the
machine itself—for in the exploitation, or you might say output, of
the thing, lay the large money-making possibilities. He was going on
glibly enough with this sort of talk—for he was feverishly excited and
spoke rapidly—when he suddenly and unexpectedly came up against the
insurmountable obstacle. At the time he did not know what it was;—he
was only aware that something had stopped him dead. There was a silence
for a full minute. Then, his mind a sickening blank, he began to
stammer out a few disconnected words, after which he was silent again
and sat staring.

Mr. Hollister, who’d been more than eager to hear what Haworth had in
the way of an invention, supposed the young man had been taken suddenly
ill (he certainly looked it) and hastened to get him a drink. But it
was all over. The young fellow couldn’t go on. And finally, in a blind
sort of way, he got up from his chair and walked dizzily out of the
office.

The elder man followed to the elevator, quite solicitous; asking if
there wasn’t something he could do, and making efforts to learn what
the trouble was. But Haworth shook his head weakly, the elevator door
clanged, and he dropped silently out of sight.

As he came out at the street entrance of the building he moved along
the wall a short distance and stood there, his eyes strained wide open.
The blow was so sudden and smashing that he was dazed, not realizing
what had struck him. He’d been there for hardly more than a minute when
the traffic policeman from the Tremont corner came hurrying along. A
lady had reported that something was the matter with a man leaning
against a building a little way up Beacon. The moment he saw Haworth he
ran across the street to him and asked what was wrong.

The young man shook his head a little, but was unable to speak.

“Live here in Boston?” the officer inquired.

“Out—Roxbury.”

“What’s the street?”

“Torrington.”

“Some ways. I’ll send a taxi.”

“No, please don’t!” Haworth was suddenly emphatic. “I can get home all
right!” Saying which, he turned and walked unsteadily up the street.

       *       *       *       *       *

He found himself awhile later, without knowing how he got there,
seated on the bench in the Public Garden where he and Edith had
been—ages ago—ages ago. He was trying to remember what he’d said to
Mr. Hollister, with the vague idea of finding out what it was that had
stopped him in the midst of the interview.

It’s an odd thing, isn’t it, what the human mind’ll do to you! While
he was talking in the office there, running as smooth as you like, the
brakes suddenly went on, the wheels creaked, and he came to a dead
stop, and all without the slightest volition on his part. Now, as he
sat there near the pond and the shouting children, he slowly came to
a realization of the reason why a certain safety device installed
somewhere in his mental machinery, had automatically brought him to
a standstill. It would be impossible to explain the device and its
operation to anyone without ruining every chance it had. That is,
_unless the people he explained it to took it_—and how could he be sure
they would?

Suddenly, after a length of time of which he had no idea, he got to his
feet. There was hope yet! A ray of hope!

He would think up some sort of _similar_ affair—a proposition involving
the same sort of risks yet in reality nothing like it. This he would
describe to a man he was trying to interest in the thing, speaking
of it casually, not as anything of his own, but as an odd thing he’d
heard of—a man he knew had gone into it, and so on. From the remarks
and behavior of a person to whom he described this similar proposition,
it was Haworth’s idea that he could gain a pretty clear indication as
to whether the man would go into such a thing himself if he got the
opportunity; and when he found one who would, he could safely let him
know exactly what it was.

There was no time to waste. He walked rapidly away, trying mightily to
conceive of some scheme that would give hazards corresponding to his
own, yet bearing no dangerous similarity to it.

Among the few men with whom he had had business dealings, he selected
the manager of a machine shop—one Mat Williams—as being the most
likely to be attracted. By the time he got to Williams’s place he had
something roughly thought out to test him with, and as soon as he
could get him aside he began telling about a friend of his who had
gone into a most unusual enterprise—which enterprise he described at
length. Williams was naturally astonished that Haworth should come
there to tell him an absurd and apparently pointless anecdote, and when
the young man began demanding avidly what he thought of it, Williams
decided that the fellow had gone completely off his nut. He was sorry,
but the only course seemed to be to get rid of him as soon as possible,
which he did, smoothing things over with pleasant talk and a hurried
handshake.

Haworth was cut up a bit, though he had no idea how bad it really
was. But as he tried one after another with his singular method of
diagnosing their speculative propensities, and found that every one of
them, instead of talking business, tried to get away from him as soon
as he possibly could, his hope began to ebb.

From one to another he went, despairingly yet without thought of
surrender, coming to expect their glances of surprise, followed
sometimes by alarm, and again by something akin to pity. He accepted
these various expressions as they came, entirely unable to account for
them, realizing only that one after another of those he approached on
the subject appeared to have a strange antipathy to hearing anything
about the hypothetical cases he hit on to try them with, and hurried
away from him at the first available opportunity.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was impossible that the night, when it came, should be anything but
a distressing one for Haworth. Though approaching people about his
machine had come, in this short space of time, to be about as enjoyable
as so many executions for murder, the poor fellow would rather have
gone on with it than lie helpless while his mind grappled with his
monstrous predicament.

After a time, when the torture of the thing passed the point of
endurance, he would stagger blindly to his feet and stride about at a
tremendous pace, having no realization of where he was. This happened
several times during the night.

The morning saw him out again with his white, emaciated face and
threadbare clothing, going mechanically from one place to another in
his vain search for some one he could rely on as a purchaser—a most
doubtful enterprise at the best, but put in the perfectly hopeless
class by his eccentric management of it, together with his disturbing
appearance and behavior.

He hunted up several speculators who had once been friendly with old
Mr. Cripps, and quite frequently, in those days, guests at the house;
he went to Mr. Trescott and even to the manager of the bank with which
he had had some modest dealings in time gone by. But there wasn’t one
of those he approached with his misguided efforts to test them out, who
was not quite convinced, after listening to him a moment, that the poor
fellow was mildly insane. Mr. Trescott was quite saddened by it, yet
hardly surprised.

The day following was Sunday, and after a hideous night of despair he
had fallen into a sort of stupor that lasted until the middle of the
afternoon. When he finally roused himself from it (he had been sitting
in a chair since the night before) the realization of his dreadful
dilemma came upon him with appalling intensity, and he went to pacing
about the house in a manner that filled Mrs. Temple with a new alarm.
There was a frantic desperation about it that terrified the old woman,
and it was some time before she got her courage up to speak to him.
She finally succeeded in waylaying him in the narrow back hall, but he
strode past without appearing to see her, crowding her against the side
wall as he did so, but of course without any idea of what he was doing.

She recovered herself as soon as she could and made another effort to
get his attention, this time calling out to him that he mustn’t go on
that way—he’d kill himself! But it seemed impossible to make him hear.

For more than an hour she listened to his tramping about, sometimes on
the floor above, sometimes in the large entrance hall or other rooms on
the ground floor, but never in the basement.

Suddenly, when it was getting on toward four o’clock, there was a
dull, muffled noise apparently coming from one of the rooms above, as
of something falling heavily on the floor, and with it the sound of
tramping ceased. Though she felt her legs weakening under her, she
toiled up the main stairway. Looking down the upper hall, she could
see from the light striking through it into the corridor that the door
of the room Mrs. Findlay had occupied was open—something unusual, for
he’d always kept it closed and locked.

She hurried, limping, down the hall and went to the door.

Haworth was lying face down on the floor, his head resting on his arms.

Mrs. Temple hastened to him, possessed only of the terrifying thought
that he was dead, and sank down on the floor at his side.... No! He was
breathing! Gently shaking him by the shoulder, she called his name.

At first there was no response, but after a little he spoke in a voice
that was half a whisper, and without raising his head asked her please
to go away—he didn’t want to be disturbed. Would she please go?

The old woman struggled to her feet and brought a pillow from another
room, feeling he wouldn’t like her to disturb the pillows in this one.
Kneeling on the floor beside him, she gently raised his head and put
the pillow under it. Then, with all the haste she was able to make, she
set out for a drug store, half a mile away on Center Street.

On reaching the place she had to wait a moment before she could
recover breath enough to ask the clerk if he could tell her where she
could find a good doctor for Mr. Haworth.... Yes, over at the Cripps
mansion.... Yes indeed, it was very serious and some one ought to see
him.

The clerk had, that very morning, been reading a full-page write-up in
one of the Sunday supplements, in which the house on Torrington Road
and its singular occupant had been fully described and illustrated.
For this reason he was instantly interested, and volunteered himself
to telephone to Doctor Crimmin’s office. If the doctor wasn’t in he’d
leave word for him to go out there as soon as he came.

Mrs. Temple thanked him and hurried away. When she got to her lodgings
she carefully closed the door, pulled out the old trunk, reached down
under the clothing in it, and brought up the cigar box, from which she
took three silver quarters, muttering to herself as she seized them:
“Rainy day! I should think so! It’s one o’ them cloudbursts!”

With these coins gripped in her withered hands, she went to the nearest
grocery store and bought four eggs, a loaf of bread, ten cents’ worth
of tea, and a small glass jar of milk, and then made all possible haste
back to the mansion.

       *       *       *       *       *

I never could find out—for certainly Haworth had no idea, and what
other witnesses were there?—how long it was after Mrs. Temple left
him face down on the floor of his room, that he became aware of the
sounding of the front-door “buzzer.” Few in his distracted state
of mind would have noticed it, nor would he had not his years of
mechanical training made him ultrasensitive to such sounds. Sensitive
also to the condition of such mechanisms and instruments, as shown by
his never failing to keep the electric bell system of the house in
perfect working order, no matter what dilapidations befell elsewhere.

Again the buzzer sounded on the floor below, echoing through the bare
half-furnished rooms. Haworth found himself vaguely realizing that Mrs.
Temple wasn’t in the house or she’d have answered the first ring.

Slowly he got to his feet, descended the stairs, and crossing the great
hall to the front door, opened it.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mr. Pentecost,—who had that morning read a Sunday supplement write-up
with headings about the “Hermit Inventor of West Roxbury,” and had come
out there (instead of taking an afternoon express for New York as he
had planned) to see if possibly some one of the devices the “Hermit
Inventor” had on hand might not come in nicely for his partner’s (Mr.
Harker’s) activities,—had hardly a doubt that it was the inventor
himself standing before him in the doorway. And although, owing to the
overshadowing elms and the roof and pillars of the portico above and
behind him, he found it difficult to see with any distinctness, he got
an instant impression, from a certain paleness of face that was almost
luminous and a peculiarity in the young fellow’s attitude or manner,
that something was wrong with him.

The two stood silent a moment, for something made the commonplace
salutation Pentecost had in mind seem quite inappropriate, and it was
the young man who finally spoke.

“What is it?” he asked in a hollow voice, slightly tremulous.

“I beg your pardon,” Pentecost hastened to say. “I called to see Mr.
Haworth.”

“What about?” still with a quivering note of near-tragedy.

“Are you Mr. Haworth?”

“Yes——but I don’t want to see anybody. Please go away.” And he was
turning back into the house.

“One moment! It’s business—entirely business—I’m sure you’ll be
interested.”

“I don’t think so,” came the hollow voice out of the gloomy half
light, and it was evident the young man was about to close the door.

“Mr. Haworth!” Pentecost spoke sharply. “Can’t you listen half a
minute? It concerns us both—and I can’t very well talk about it here.”

Haworth stared at him an instant and then, opening the door a little
wider, made a slight motion of invitation.

Pentecost stepped in with a muttered, “You’re very kind,” and glanced
quickly about the vast entrance hall in which he found himself—an
enormous place two stories in height and with a great stairway at the
further end rising to a landing and from that branching to each side.
The place was seemingly quite destitute of furniture or floor covering,
and he found himself wondering how the young man had managed to make no
sound when he crossed it to open the door. He would look at his feet
later, when there was more light; it was very dim in the hall.

Closing the massive front door, Haworth moved to the large double
doorway on the left—on the left as you enter the house, I mean—and
stood waiting for his caller to enter before him. Pentecost did so and
found himself in a large and lofty room with high paneled wainscoting
of some dark wood, and a white marble mantel on the side opposite as
he came in. There were two large windows in that wall—one on either
side of the fireplace, though not near it; and another in the wall
at his left which faced off toward Torrington Road. At the further
end of the room—which was quite a distance, as it was an exceedingly
long one—were two doors, one of which (a swing door held partly open
by a chair shoved against it) revealed a butler’s pantry beyond. This
large apartment was evidently the dining room—or once had been. The
wainscoting, heavily built and with deeply set panels, was fully six
feet high and extended entirely around it.

Though somewhat shadowed, this room was lighter than the great hall,
and he saw mechanical blueprints and drawings laid out on a cheap
kitchen table near the middle of it, with small tools and implements
scattered about. Books and papers were piled and balanced here and
there. The floor was covered with what had once been a handsome
carpet—now worn and threadbare. The windows, he noticed, had cheap
roller shades to them—but judging from the cornices and rich but faded
lambrequins above—had once evidently had the heavy draperies of an
earlier fashion.

Pentecost was an instantaneous observer, requiring no time exposure,
so that there had hardly been a pause when he turned to speak to
Haworth. But Haworth wasn’t there. He had followed into the room after
Pentecost, but had slipped to one side and was now wandering back
and forth along the wall toward the further end. He appeared to have
forgotten the other’s presence, and his eyes shifted about, giving him
the look of one tortured by some harrowing thought or memory. In a few
moments his restless glance accidentally fell on Pentecost and he came
to a sudden stop and stood staring at him.

“Oh—you!” he muttered, half to himself.

“Quite right,” said Pentecost.

“Well, what is it?” the young man asked, moving toward him.

“Perhaps I ought not to have intruded like this.”

“As you have,” came back the hollow voice out of the gloom, “why don’t
you tell me what you want?”

“It’s a matter of some importance to us and I thought it might be to
you. I represent a firm——Great God! what’s the matter?”

For as Haworth approached him out of the shadows at the far end of the
room and the light from the front window fell on his face, Pentecost
saw it distinctly for the first time, and the eyes that looked out at
him from the drawn and almost distorted features might have been those
of a drowning man.

“Matter?” the young man repeated.

“Why—yes. Are you—are you feeling all right Mr. Haworth?”

“You said you came about something important.”

“Yes—I did—but perhaps you——”

“If it’s money I owe you take anything you want and go away—that’s
all—go away!” Saying which, Haworth turned and started walking
restlessly about the room as he was doing before.

“Not at all—not at all! There’s nothing like that! It’s just the other
way—I’m going to put a few dollars in _your_ pocket if you’ve got
anything I can use.”

Haworth, halfway down the room, swung round with a look of such
fearful and desperate avidity that Pentecost saw at once it was a case
of money. The young fellow was in some dire extremity—some feverish
need that mere destitution, even to the point of starvation, wouldn’t
explain. Couldn’t be a more favorable situation for business. Easy to
drive him to the wall and get one of his inventions for a block of
stock—in other words, for nothing.

“I represent a firm of promoters—New York—Harker & Pentecost.”
He took a card from his pocketbook. “We’re always looking for
novelty—something different from anything that’s been on the market
before.”

Mr. Pentecost paused, but the young man said nothing, and he went
on: “It came to us a short time ago that you had some extraordinary
inventions here and if——”

“There’s nothing you’d want,” Haworth interrupted.

“But perhaps—if you’d allow me to see what——”

“There’s no use in that! They come—hundreds of them—just want me to let
them see. Then they’re sorry, but there’s nothing of practical use.
That’s it—always nothing practical—always—always!” He moved away.

“It’s nothing to me whether the thing’s practical or not!”

Haworth stopped and stood looking at him.

“I’m not looking for carpet sweepers,” Pentecost went on, “or fireless
cookers or any of those things that people are tired of reading
advertisements about. The thing I’m after is novelty—something
absolutely new and unheard of—something impressive in its operation so
we can exploit it and give it a chance. Now it struck me from what I
heard, that your work would perhaps be just the kind——”

He was halted in the midst of his talk by the way Haworth was staring
at him. It wouldn’t have surprised him to get an indication on the
fellow’s face that he’d just thought of one of his devices that would
be what was wanted. But that wasn’t it. For soon he saw that the young
inventor was studying _him_—figuring out what sort of a character he
really was. Those strange and troubled eyes were fixed on him with an
intense scrutiny that penetrated below the surface.

To divert this rather too close attention to himself, Pentecost spoke
with more emphasis than before.

“I see you’ve thought of something, Mr. Haworth.”

There was no verbal response to this, but a barely perceptible motion
of his head while still gazing intently at Pentecost, might be taken to
mean that he had.

“Anything near what we’re looking for, do you think?”

“I don’t know.”

“I hope it’s something unusual,” Pentecost said, cheerfully; “some
novelty that’ll make ’em talk.”

“It will do that.”

“What made you say just now that you hadn’t anything I’d want?”

“This is something else.”

Pentecost was inclined to think the fellow had illusions. Anyone could
see there was something wrong with him.

“Well, bring it along,” he suggested. “Let’s have a look at it.”

The answer was a slight negative head-shake.

“Too heavy?”

“It’s built in.”

“Where?”

“Under here—in the basement.”

“I see. Something to operate in a home. What does it do?”

“I want you to come down.”

“Certainly, Mr. Haworth. Lead the way.”

Notwithstanding that Pentecost felt convinced that the young man had
signals set for some sort of brain storm and that he himself knew a
thing or two about basements in relation to crime, the notion of not
going down there when the distracted inventor suggested the idea,
didn’t come within miles of occurring to him. He had a hunch there was
something here for him—something extraordinary, too—and he was going
after it.

Haworth moved nearer. “Mr.——What did you say your——”

“Pentecost.”

“Mr. Pentecost, I’ve decided to tell you everything.”

“The best thing you could do Mr. Haworth.”

“I find you’re the person I’ve been looking for.”

“You’re very kind to say so. Shall we go down and have a look at it?”

From Haworth’s last remark, Pentecost feared that after all he was
hopeless.

“I’ll get the key.”

“Secret, eh?”

“Yes.”

“No patent?”

Haworth shook his head.

“What about the people you’ve shown it to?”

“There are none.”

“And you haven’t told anybody?”

“No.”

That sounded better. The chap had some sort of sense, anyway. But not
the sense to patent it. That was too bad.

“The key’s upstairs.” And he started toward the entrance hall.

“Could we switch on a light here, Mr. Haworth? It’s a trifle overcast.”

“I’ll tell Mrs. Temple to light a lamp,” the young man answered from
the door, and he hurried out.

So they’d cut off his current, Pentecost reflected—for he’d noticed
electric fixtures about. Although hardly late enough for twilight,
there was much the same thing in this vast and gloomy room with its
dark walls and tree-shaded and vine-overgrown windows. Pentecost wanted
to see what—if anything—was going on here. Something made him feel that
whatever it was might be turned to his advantage.

Soon after Haworth left the room, Pentecost saw in the dimness the
frail figure of a woman coming toward the table from the further end.
Mrs. Temple, probably—the one he’d spoken of. He saw from her unsteady
gait and bent figure that she was old and somewhat decrepit, and the
momentary clicking of the lamp chimney against the glass shade as she
took it off told of her trembling hands.

The old woman had reached home with her modest packages of food only
a few moments before, and was greatly relieved as she passed down the
flagged footpath to the kitchen, to catch a glimpse of Mr. Haworth
through a side window of the living room; for it was evidence that he
had recovered sufficiently to come downstairs. An instant later she
saw that he wasn’t alone. A strange man—at least a stranger to her—was
standing near the table and appeared to be watching the young fellow
intently as he moved about. Then it came to her that he must be the
doctor. Who else could it be? He certainly had the look of one with his
close trimmed beard—and watching Mr. Haworth like that.

After getting the lamp shade and chimney off, Mrs. Temple groped
about and found a match somewhere; but instead of striking it she
straightened up—so far as she could—and after a glance at the door
spoke in a low voice.

“You’re the doctor, ain’t ye?”

“No, madam,” Pentecost answered.

Mrs. Temple stared blankly at him, seeming for some reason to be
astonished. “You ain’t?” she finally said.

“Certainly not. Are you feeling ill, madam?”

“Me?” looking at him in a surprised sort of way. “No!”

After an instant she again bent over the lamp and lighted it,
regulating the flame by the little brass disk at the side. Pentecost
saw her thin, withered old hands trembling under the light.

“Perhaps it’s Mr. Haworth who isn’t well?” he ventured.

The old woman looked at him. “You ain’t blind, be ye?” she asked.

“Not exactly, madam,” with a trace of a smile. “I saw he wasn’t looking
quite right——”

“It’s a great sight more’n not lookin’ _right_!” Then she turned to him
suddenly. “What’re you doin’ here?” she demanded sharply, yet keeping
her voice subdued.

“I came on business.”

“Well ef it’s money you’re after you can talk to me. He ain’t in no
condition to be pestered; you ain’t got much jedgment about ye ef ye
can’t see that.”

“But my dear madam, I assure you——”

“Sh!” She was fussing with the lamp as Haworth came in.

“What’s the matter?” he asked, seeing her bending over it. “Won’t it
work?”

“Yes,” she said, stooping and looking under the shade.

“I guess it’s liable to go now.”

“I want to take it downstairs, Mrs. Temple——This way, Mr. Pentecost.”
The latter followed him across the great bare hall, to a door under
the branching stairway on the left, and through this to a back hall at
the further end of which the basement stairway descended.

Mrs. Temple stood motionless at the table where they’d left her.
Strange as it may seem when you realize the briefness of the time,
this decrepit old woman, bent and knotted with rheumatism, her hands
tremulous with the palsy of age, had conceived a deep and implacable
distrust of the man she had just heard addressed as Mr. Pentecost. She
didn’t reason about it or ask herself why—that wasn’t her method. She
simply accepted it and was determined to do what she could.

Ever since Haworth had built the small room in the basement some weeks
before, he’d been working feverishly day and night on what she supposed
to be one of his inventions, seeming so desperately bent on completing
the thing, and for the last day or two plunged in such dreadful
despair, that the poor woman was beside herself with anxiety. She’d
often seen him through times of such absorption in his work that he
would have starved if she hadn’t kept after him with food, but there’d
never been anything so terrible as this and she couldn’t find out what
was the matter.

And now had come this sinister-looking creature (though to save her
life she couldn’t have said what was sinister about him) enveloped,
it seemed to her, in an atmosphere of cunning and intrigue so dense
that she could feel it, and Mr. Haworth had taken him down into the
basement—most likely to that secret room he’d been working in so
desperately—where the fellow was undoubtedly arranging some infamous
plan or deviltry involving him.

Haworth, as soon as the door of the roughly planked room was closed on
them, had stripped away the sheet that covered his mechanism from view
and had begun to describe to Pentecost what it was intended to do. He
was in the midst of this when Pentecost suddenly stopped him with a
quick motion of his hand.

The lamp with its green shade stood on the top board of a stepladder,
throwing a weird light on the two men facing each other in silence.

Haworth, recovering from his surprise (for he hadn’t heard anything)
started to speak, but Pentecost shook his head emphatically, and after
a moment’s pause whispered: “I hear someone!”

There was another pause. “You think somebody’s listening?” Haworth
asked in a subdued voice.

“What I _think_ cuts no figure. This is where we take no chances!” And
Pentecost suddenly threw open the door.

The light struck on old Mrs. Temple as she was going in through the
door of Haworth’s workshop nearly opposite. She’d caught a word or two
about some one listening and noted the sudden lowering of their voices
just in time to turn back and get into the shop.

“Oh, Mrs. Temple!” Pentecost called in the most ordinary tone. “I’m on
the hunt for a drink of water. Maybe you’d get me some, if it isn’t too
much trouble?”

The old woman reappeared at the door with a bunch of chips and shavings
in her hands. “It ain’t no trouble,” she mumbled without the faintest
trace of embarrassment, and limped along to the stairway. Pentecost
watched her labor up the stairs, then turned to Haworth standing in the
door of the planked-up room.

“That old dame of yours is right on the mark,” he said in an undertone.
“Came out of there with a bunch of shavings.”

“Yes—my shop. She gets them for the stove.”

“So I inferred,” said Pentecost. His admiration was because she’d
managed it so deftly and said nothing about it. An amateur would have
mentioned the stove. Just as well to keep an eye on that old lady.

She soon came back with the water. Pentecost took it from her. “Awful
sorry to trouble you,” he said, “—and all those stairs to climb.” He
took a sip of water. “You won’t need anything more down here perhaps?”

“Anything more?” she repeated in a puzzled way.

“Kindlings, for instance?”

“Not if the fire goes, I won’t.”

“I’m trusting, then, that it’ll do that.”

They stood looking at each other for an instant. Then the old woman
turned and went hobbling off into the shadows of the basement and could
be dimly seen toiling up the stairs.

A moment before she disappeared Pentecost said to Haworth, speaking
distinctly but not raising his voice, “It’s a remarkable invention,
Mr. Haworth—one that, handled properly, would make money; and I’d like
to talk business with you.” Then, setting down the glass of water, he
asked if he could have something out of his workshop.

“Of course,” Haworth said, hardly understanding. “What is it?”

“A piece of board five or six feet long—a light one about the size of a
lath.”

They found a piece of narrow half-inch stuff, and Pentecost stood it
against the wall, slanting across the path of anyone walking through
the passageway in the darkness. He balanced it so that a touch would
send it clattering down.

“Mrs. Temple wouldn’t listen, if that’s what you think,” Haworth said
as they went back to the room.

“Of course not,” agreed Pentecost as he carefully closed the door. “Go
ahead with it,” he whispered, “but keep the soft pedal on. Basement’s
safe enough, but there’s a room above.”

“Yes, but Mrs. Temple would never——”

“I know—I know. She’s all right. Hell of a pity you don’t know what
talent you’ve got in the house! Go on now. What the devil _is_ all
this?”

And thereafter had anyone been at the rear end of the room on the
left (which was the one above) or even in the basement itself, only
the faint droning tones of conversation could have been heard, with
occasional clanking and grinding sounds suggesting the revolution of
geared wheels. No words could have been distinguished and the fact
that toward the end of the interview, after Pentecost’s voice had been
going on in a subdued but earnest murmur for quite a time, it was
suddenly stopped, as though something had shut him off in the midst
of a sentence, and that then, for several minutes following, there
was absolute silence, could only have mystified without in the least
enlightening anyone in a position to overhear.

In reality there was no mystery whatever, and the whole discussion
between the two in that basement room was simple and straightforward.
It was only that while Mr. Pentecost was in the very act of telling Mr.
Haworth that there were various reasons why it was impossible for his
firm to take on this remarkable idea of his for exploitation, there
suddenly came to him—flashing through his mind in the characteristic
way he hit on such things—a most ingenious scheme or operation that
could be worked in connection with this device of Haworth’s—and in
fact with nothing else; a scheme that appealed to him by reason of its
extraordinary possibilities for shrewd maneuvering and complicated
trickery and strategy, and because it was dangerous, cold-blooded, and
terrible.

It came crashing in on him in the very midst of his declining to have
anything to do with the Haworth invention—even while he was advising
Haworth himself to let it alone—and naturally brought him to a stop
that was near to being a jolt. The rest of his sentence remained
unspoken. He sat motionless, his mind flooded with his new idea, a
blank to everything else. And when Haworth, who had taken his refusal
as final, at last muttered something about going upstairs, he rose from
the wooden box on which he was sitting and followed.

Haworth, in the room above, set the lamp down and stood staring into
vacancy.

Pentecost hunched himself up in a chair where he sat with his dark
half-closed eyes fastened on the young inventor. He was figuring on
what the chap would be likely to do under certain circumstances—the
most effective method of taking care of him should he prove an
obstacle—the safeguards he could use.

He was as certain that he’d purchase the rights for handling and
exploiting the Haworth machine—but doing so in his own way—as he
was that he saw the young fellow there before him. It was a chance
he’d been looking for ever since he left Chicago. He’d pay anything
necessary. But of course he knew how to manage so that the said
“necessary” would be an insignificant figure.

Haworth began to walk up and down the room. Pentecost watched him for a
while.

“What seems to be the matter?” he finally asked.

The young man stopped in his tracks and looked at him.

“I thought you said you wouldn’t take it.”

“I’m not the only man on earth.”

“It’s the time—the time!”

Pentecost regarded him from under his drooping eyelids.

“You’re looking for a bunch of money?” he asked.

“Yes—oh yes!” And Haworth turned and began to move about.

“Look here,” Pentecost called out to him after a while. “Just to
satisfy my curiosity, put an index to it!”

“Index?” Haworth stopped and faced him.

“What amount?”

“I don’t know. A lot—thousands—I must have thousands.”

“How many?”

“All I can get—twenty. No, wait! More! Thirty—forty——”

“The fool that would give you that isn’t born yet.”

“How do you know? Wait! I’ve thought of something! I’ll go to the
moving-picture men. They’ll take an interest—they’re bound to—the
pictures are part of it—and they pay great prices—they pay thousands!”

Moving-picture men! And the distracted young fellow was capable of
doing it. Might get something out of them, too, if he happened to
strike a crooked concern.

“I don’t suppose you could wait a few days,” Pentecost mumbled in
an uninterested sort of way. “There’s a bare chance I’ve thought
of—though I doubt if it’s as good as the pictures at that.” (Of course
he couldn’t appear to block the picture game. The price would go up on
him—or would if the chap knew anything.)

“For yourself?” Haworth asked, eagerly; for he’d got it firmly fixed in
his mind that this man was the one choice on earth for the carrying out
of his idea.

Pentecost shook his head. “No,” he said, “but I’ve got a partner. I’ve
known him to take a fling at something on his own account—if he took a
fancy to it.”

“Where is he?”

“Pittsburgh—on business. He might be able to get here by Friday.”

“Five days!”

“Good man for you, too. Just his line. Done this sort of thing before.”

“But you don’t know he’d take it! I can’t wait five days and then
have him say no! I’ll try the pictures. There was a man here last
week—wanted to take me working at the lathe—said he’d read about me in
a paper. I know where he is. I’ll find him to-night!”

There could be no doubt that the fellow would do as he said. He hadn’t
the faintest idea in his system of what a “bluff” was. And the fear
of losing this rare chance for ingenious chicanery drove Pentecost
into the execution of what is popularly referred to as a “climb down.”
Although able to camouflage this performance so that it did not appear
in that unpleasant light, he had, before leaving the old Cripps mansion
that evening, virtually guaranteed that his firm would take over the
entire exploiting rights in the Haworth mechanism, and had agreed to
pay for the same in cash, upon the signing of the contract, an amount
which should be “satisfactory” to the young inventor. As to this
payment he asked for a delay of fourteen days so that he could sound
the market, the idea of the thing being so utterly unique that it was
impossible at this time to estimate the exact figure they could pay.
And as he needed every moment of the fourteen days option—as you might
call it, and this being Sunday and so late anyway that nothing could
be accomplished, he asked that the time allowed begin on the following
day—Monday—at noon, bringing its expiration on Monday the 30th of
August at the same hour.

With talk like this—which, as you see, bound him to nothing—in
combination with the young man’s earnest desire that he should be the
one to undertake the exploitation, Haworth was persuaded into this
fourteen days delay, being made confident of receiving a large amount
of money at the end of that time. Pentecost said he would bring Harker
there to draw up the contract, on his return from Pittsburgh, and
then this promoter of hazardous and extraordinary villainies rose to
take his leave, slipping a bunch of bills on the table as he did so,
with the explanation that what he’d got—though not in legal form—was
really a fourteen-day option, and as option money he was leaving a
couple of hundred. There was nothing of kindliness or rescue work
involved in this; Pentecost had sized up Haworth well enough to know
that acceptance of money would make him feel in honor bound to wait
the fourteen days—bound firmer, indeed, than if he’d signed documents.
A wary move, certain to prevent the young fellow, in a possible fit
of desperation, from taking his astonishing idea to a motion picture
concern.

The delay he’d asked for was absolutely necessary to Pentecost for the
carrying through of the complicated campaign mapped out in his mind.
Advance planting of a most unusual character and covering a great
extent of territory was required. In addition there was the matter of
Haworth himself—the chances—the safeguards—for he was a risk beyond
computation. He had insisted on the payment being made to him in cash
at the expiration of the fourteen days—if the firm decided to purchase
the rights. It looked like a big bunch of money dropped in his lap
and no anchor to it—an impossible situation. Of course the fellow
would have to be taken care of. The way to do it was the problem. But
Pentecost very well knew he’d have a solution—and an adroit one—before
morning.

He boarded the midnight train for New York fifteen minutes before
leaving time, and at once went to work on his intricate scheme.




PART VI


When Stephen W. Harker of Harker & Pentecost returned from Pittsburgh,
where he’d been “planting” for a nice little Gasoline Substitute
Swindle (stock selling, of course—that was his department) and had sat
in for an hour with Pentecost, getting the details of the extraordinary
Haworth device and the elaborate scheme his partner had evolved for its
exploitation, he vehemently refused to have anything to do with it. Not
for by George and all hell was he going to put his head in a noose like
that when he had a nice safe little business that was raking it in as
fast as he wanted it.

“You got me going once when you had the firm into that damned Folsam
affair—you know the one—came out his wife had hit him with something in
his tea. You’d got a grip some way so you could hold it back an’ play
it. I dipped in with you an’ no complaint at the time. But now I’ll
tell you _that_ was too close for me and this time you’re going to jump
plumb into the middle of the shake-off! You must be dippy! They’ll get
you sure! Anyways, you can count me good an’ out.”

Pentecost sat toadlike, silent, regarding Harker with bulging,
half-closed eyes.

“Now hook to this,” Harker went on; “if the turn is against you and
they’re fixing you for the clamps, I back your play to ooze out of
anything. But I get loose teeth if I mix in with those little sports
that look like raspberry tarts to you. Now this Haworth layout—it
looks to me like a frolic with the undertaker; but if you like it for
yourself, go to it!”

“I’ve gone to it,” Pentecost murmured in a careless sort of way; “and I
play it under the firm name.”

“But my God—wait! That gets _me_ in!”

“Why, so it does!”

“What are you doing, dragging me into a play whether I want it or not?”

“Can that!” Pentecost flashed sudden fire for an instant. “Do you think
I planned this damned firm to keep you under glass?”

There was a short pause and Pentecost’s blaze-out subsided.

After a while Harker spoke in another tone, now petulant and pleading.
“You going to jam me up against that layout an’ nothing to say?”

“You can make your getaway now.”

“Jump the firm?”

“Why not? In that case, jump while the jumping’s good.”

Harker, on that, said no more. He’d go a long way before dropping the
partnership. It wasn’t alone losing the tidy and “classy” business
as it was now run through Pentecost’s putting it on a straight-play
basis, but even more than that he appreciated the association with this
marvelous operator. It gave him the feeling of trailing along with a
giant, a super-sharp, a past master of crookedness. He gave the matter
of the Haworth enterprise deep thought, and by noon of the following
day had decided to play in on it, saying to himself that he’d bar
worrying by putting his trust in Pentecost.

On the afternoon of the same day that Mr. Harker declared himself in
on the West Roxbury undertaking, both members of the firm embarked on
a steamer of the Metropolitan Line for Boston. The boat was the _North
Land_ and this line was the “all-the-way-by-water” route, the steamers
after traversing Long Island and Block Island Sounds and Buzzards Bay,
passing through the Cape Cod Canal into Barnstable Bay, and thence
through Cape Cod and Massachusetts Bay into Boston Harbor.

It was the fourth day after Pentecost’s visit to the Cripps mansion and
the firm was proceeding to Boston as agreed, in order to discuss with
Haworth various points of the contract—the amount to be paid down, the
delivery of the machine, and other matters connected with the sale—so
that the papers could be drawn up ready for signature on the day the
option expired.

Mr. Pentecost had already accomplished a great deal, having got in
reports from his men (if it was ordinary business you’d call them
correspondents) in all the large cities, and also having come to the
determination to carry on the thing himself in such of those towns as
he finally selected, instead of selling to the central agency or bureau
handling this class of material,—a bureau which he found to be run by
“pikers,” mortally afraid to pay big money for big chances. In addition
to this, it was safer not to trust them in so ticklish a business. So
he had it all laid out, and his own men were already where he wanted
them or on the way. He’d sent a couple of his choicest “trusties” over
to Boston the day before. Of course the main work was going to be there.

The taking of a steamer instead of going by rail, and also the
selection of this particular line, were both essential to Mr.
Pentecost’s scheme; and the same thing made it imperative that,
following their interview with Haworth, they return to New York by
the same boat on which they went over. So important was this latter,
indeed, that had they been unable to secure return accommodations
on the _North Land_, Pentecost would have postponed the trip until
both the going and returning could have been accomplished on the same
steamer—he did not care which of the two running on this route it was.

Awhile after the _North Land_ left—they must have been about running
out into the Sound at Hell Gate—Mr. Pentecost went to the purser’s
window to make inquiries about the tickets for the return trip (he had
left the matter to be adjusted when he came on board, merely having
been informed by telephone that the reservations had been made), and
after finishing with the business remarked jovially to Mr. Lawson (the
purser) that that was a damn good picture of a locomotive he had on the
wall there behind him. It represented, lithographed in color, a giant
locomotive hauling a night express on the New York Central, and so
realistically coming toward you that your first impulse was to make one
grand hurdle for your life. The purser, pleased at the appreciation,
for he had a fad on locomotives (a fact which Pentecost had obtained
from the comprehensive report on the steamer and its officers turned in
by one of his men), said it was a pretty good one, but he thought the
one they got out the year before beat it.

The conversation resulted in Mr. Pentecost’s being invited into the
office, and when business at the window permitted the purser showed him
other views of locomotives.

Pentecost didn’t stay long. He knew enough not to drive an entering
wedge too far.

By evening they had a slight acquaintance with several of the officers,
and Pentecost had made a most favorable impression on the head waiter
as well—this latter through the poignant influence of an extraordinary
tip; and along toward nine-thirty or ten o’clock the purser, with
whom he was chatting over cigars, introduced him to Captain Snow, who
happened along just then, and the three talked about the canal.

Pentecost made many intelligent inquiries on the subject and Harker
came along and listened in with great interest. So that the total
result of the voyage was most satisfactory from Pentecost’s point of
view. With no hint of pushing or forcing themselves they had a fairly
good traveler’s acquaintance with the captain, the purser, and several
minor officers of the _North Land_, as well as the head waiter and
one or two of the deck hands of whom they’d asked questions. Also the
chief engineer, to whom they’d been turned over on expressing a wish
to have a look at the “power plant,” as they called it. Pentecost had
made this engine room move in order to bring it in casually that they
were especially interested in machinery—almost their business, you
might say. Indeed, that they were even then on their way to Boston to
negotiate for the purchase of the rights in a most ingenious mechanical
contrivance, though they weren’t positive of being able to get it. Held
at so high a figure. But an extraordinary thing in its way.

       *       *       *       *       *

The _North Land_ backed into her berth at India Wharf, Boston, shortly
after 8 o’clock the next morning, and Messrs. Harker & Pentecost were
driven to the hotel they were in the habit of patronizing when there
(except at such times as they preferred to have their presence in that
town unobserved), and went to the room which had been reserved by wire.
Alfred Harker, son of the senior partner, who’d come over on the train
that left New York at midnight (there’s an “Owl” in each direction you
know), had been waiting for them there since about half-past six in the
morning.

After breakfasting together and going over a few matters, the three
came down into the hotel office and sat there smoking and chatting. One
of the house managers came along. An assistant manager, I believe he
was. His name was Tate.

He greeted Pentecost and Harker by name, and Alfred (who hadn’t been
there before) was introduced.

“Boston on business?” Mr. Tate inquired, pleasantly.

“That’s it,” said Pentecost; “rather an odd business, too.”

“Not so much the _business_ that’s odd,” put in Harker, “but what it
brings us up against. Maybe you can give us a pointer or two. We’re
trying to buy a mechanical device—invention, you know—from the queerest
duck you ever saw, out Roxbury way.”

“Queer, eh?”

“Just bordering on the lunatic fringe,” Pentecost took it up, “but a
crackerjack on mechanics. Got a lot of strange devices in his shop out
there; most of ’em no earthly use but marvels of ingenuity, nearly
every one. Went out there to see ’em a few days ago—Sunday it was. In
fact, it was a Sunday paper put me on to it. Full-page write-up about
the chap—pictures of him and all that.”

“Oh yes,” Tate put in. “I saw it—I mean the heading—that’s all I read.
Something about a hermit, wasn’t it?”

“That’s right.”

“Has some ingenious things, you say?”

“Remarkable! No idea I’d find anything we wanted when I saw the
tumble-down place; but, if you’ll believe it, he had one of the most
novel inventions I ever laid eyes on; in fact, just the kind of thing
we’re after. Exploiting’s our business, you know. I got an option on it
and we’re over here to get the thing if we can.”

“What’s the man’s name—I forget?”

“Haworth—Charles Michael Haworth, if you want it all. I suppose you
can’t tell us anything about him?”

But aside from having caught a glimpse of that heading Mr. Tate had
never heard of the man. He assured them, though, that he was going to
make inquiries, and if he got hold of anything he’d certainly let them
know. They thanked him, and not long after that the three went out and
took a carefully selected taxi for West Roxbury.

I don’t want you to get the idea that there were any loose ends about
what these super-sharps were doing—not for one half of one per cent.
They figured the play to a hair. In this case they had Tate cribbed for
a witness.

       *       *       *       *       *

Although the day set for the visit of Harker, Pentecost, and Alfred
to the mansion on Torrington Road was not one of Mrs. Temple’s days
_in_ according to custom, but was branded by the calendar as a Friday
(which was one of her days _out_) the old woman was there just the
same. Since the appearance of Mr. Pentecost at the house nearly a week
before she had been obsessed by the feeling that he was working up
some treacherous plot against the trusting young fellow in her charge,
and she was determined to be on hand to keep a watch on the vicious
brute if he came to the house again—as she had no doubt whatever that
he would.

But Haworth had taken note of this tendency of Mrs. Temple’s to be
present irrespective of her days in and finding her there on this
particular morning he had sent the old woman on an errand which would
keep her away for some time. So when the party arrived at the house it
was he who opened the door.

Mr. Pentecost greeted him and introduced his partner, Mr. Harker, and
Mr. Alfred Harker, after which Haworth ushered them into the room on
the left. It was all peculiarly quiet and subdued. Few words were
spoken, and those that were, in lowered voices. Pentecost took notice
of Haworth’s improved appearance—his quiet, steady voice and the
absence of the tortured look and the “drowning-man” stare.

After the four were seated there was a brief pause. They seemed
weighed down by some sort of oppressive restraint that could almost be
described as funereal.

It was Harker senior who finally began the conversation, endeavoring,
with an allusion to Boston’s climate, to establish a commonplace
atmosphere—though one hardly more cheerful; and Harker junior hastened
to his assistance with a reference to his surprise at so rural a
section being in the heart of the town. He supposed Roxbury—or was it
Jamaica Plain?—might be so considered.

Pentecost turned them to business, remarking that there wasn’t any time
to throw away, and that the first thing was to go down and inspect
the machine under consideration, so that the Harkers could get a
clear understanding of it. Before they did this, however, he would
appreciate information as to the whereabouts of the talented old lady
he had seen there on his previous visit. Haworth explained that Mrs.
Temple had been dispatched on an errand to East Boston and would have
to wait there about three hours before the foundry people could get her
the article he’d ordered. Pentecost inquired how much time the journey
to East Boston and return would normally require. Haworth thought, with
the walk necessary when she got there, it might roughly be put at two
hours.

“How long ago did she leave?” Pentecost inquired.

“About twenty minutes.”

“An hour and forty minutes left,” and he glanced at his watch.

“Four hours and forty minutes, if she waits there three,” corrected
Alfred.

“As you say—if she waits there three,” was Pentecost’s muttered
rejoinder.

The four men spent over an hour in the planked-up room, various sounds
of clanking machinery and low-toned conversation issuing therefrom.
When they finally completed their investigations and were coming
out, Mr. Pentecost expressed the wish to see others of Mr. Haworth’s
inventions; so the young man, after lighting Mr. Harker and Alfred to
the stairway, took him to the large room where he kept his working
models. In this way Pentecost got the opportunity of speaking with
Haworth alone.

There were a number of matters relative to the exploitation of the
invention in the planked-up room that he wished to arrange with the
young man personally. Nothing in all this was a secret from Harker, who
understood that it would be better for Pentecost to arrange matters
with Haworth personally, afterward turning over the results, as you
might say, to his partner.

In the course of this interview in the model room Pentecost spoke
earnestly for some time. Haworth’s rejoinders were short and quiet, but
it was perfectly evident that what he said, he meant.

After several matters had been gone over, Pentecost turned his
attention to the inventions he had come in there to see, for his wish
to look them over wasn’t altogether a blind. Eventually he came upon
one that suited the purpose he had in view. It showed great ingenuity,
and it was not patented—two most desirable points.

When the two men came upstairs they found Mr. Harker and Alfred seated
at the table in the room on the left, working on the rough draft of the
proposed agreement. A sound and businesslike contract with Haworth was
of the utmost importance to the firm.

They’d been discussing the matter for some time when Pentecost stopped
them with a quick motion of his hand and sat listening. After a moment
he glanced at his watch. The time was nineteen minutes after twelve.

“Gave us four minutes longer than I figured,” he muttered in an
undertone.

“Mrs. Temple?” from Alfred in a whisper.

Haworth, amazed, incredulous, started up to investigate, but Pentecost
indicated that he’d like to attend to it himself. Tiptoeing to the
swing door of the butler’s pantry at the farther end of the room, he
stood close to it, listening for a second, then suddenly pushed it open
and went out, the door closing itself after him. Sounds like the moving
of furniture came from the kitchen, and Pentecost soon reëntered as
though nothing unusual had taken place. Instead, though, of sitting
where he’d been before, he pushed a chair close to the door into the
big entrance hall, which door he opened a few inches, and sat in such
a position that he could command a view of the main stairway at the
farther end of the hall.

“Shall I go on?” Alfred inquired after a moment.

“Why not?” said Pentecost.

Alfred read the draft of the contract, and when he came to the blank
left for the amount that Haworth was to get when the agreement was
signed, he stopped and looked at Pentecost. The latter said that Mr.
Haworth had consented to allow the matter to stand over till the day
of signing—nine days from then. However, he would say before witnesses
that it would be a figure satisfactory to Mr. Haworth after considering
certain facts which he, Pentecost, would then be in a position to give
him. “He’s willing,” and Pentecost said it appreciatively, “to allow us
that much more time to feel out the market.”

He then went on to tell them that, as a result of a discussion they’d
just had in the basement, Mr. Haworth had agreed to another matter to
be included in the contract. It was to the effect that, in case the
negotiations for the purchase of the invention were successful, Mr.
Haworth would sign for a term of five years, to work exclusively for
the firm of Harker & Pentecost, on such inventive undertakings as they
should designate, receiving as compensation a salary of six thousand a
year.

Harker was struck with astonishment at this, but in an instant realized
the importance of the stipulation to the firm. Alfred, too, was
surprised—though he showed no sign of it. Neither need have troubled
to hide his feelings, as Haworth cared nothing about them one way or
another.

Alfred was beginning to put away the papers in his document case, when
Pentecost spoke of wishing to suggest a method for safeguarding the
secrecy of this unpatented mechanism when they had occasion to refer
to it in any way, orally or in writing. His idea was that they allude
to it as “The Machine,” and in case some allusion to the mechanism was
necessary, they should use for that purpose, _as a blind_, some other
of Mr. Haworth’s inventions, preferably an apparatus on which a patent
_had_ been allowed. “Letters may fall into the hands of outsiders,”
Mr. Pentecost explained. “Telegrams and telephonic communications are
of necessity known to various persons, and personal conversations are
quite liable to be overheard. By using the name and description of some
other device these dangers may be eliminated and we will understand
what is meant.” He happened to come upon one of Mr. Haworth’s earlier
inventions that would very well answer the purpose—a combination gas
and compressed-air engine, really a most ingenious thing. They could
speak of this as “The Machine” or as “The Gas and Air Engine,” and
allude to its construction when necessary. He was very desirous of
having this blind used in the contract—for contracts frequently have to
be made public and this would make everything safe.

This ended the discussion of the contract. But Pentecost, turning to
Haworth, said there was an important matter that he rather hated to
speak of, but with an extra-hazardous operation like this it was vital.

“What is it?” Haworth asked, slightly apprehensive.

“I’m going to ask you to give that admirable old lady of yours a
vacation.”

Pentecost was taking care to turn away from the slightly open door to
the hall while speaking. “You must see, Mr. Haworth,” he went on in a
lowered voice, “that it won’t do to have her about for the next ten
days. The machine,—by that I mean the one we’re taking—is going to be
exposed at the time of its ‘delivery’—perhaps before. She knows it’s in
that room down there; you can’t touch _her_ with any decoy. She may not
understand machinery, but she’d give it away to others who did.”

Haworth was silent for a moment. A great ache gripped his throat, and
he finally spoke in a voice that he couldn’t quite control: “You don’t
know how—how true she’s been—how kind! Why she—she’d do anything for
me!”

“Yes, my friend, and there’s where she’d play particular hell with us!
That old dame’s no fool. And the trouble is, she’s got the idea there’s
something going on here and she’s all set to protect you from it.”

“Yes, yes—she’d do that!” Haworth murmured, huskily.

“Not _would_—is now!”

The young man looked at him suddenly.

Pentecost nodded. “In the butler’s pantry there a few minutes ago,” he
went on; “slid back into the kitchen as I was going to the door. When
I got out there she was hustling up the back stairway. I shut the door
at the bottom of the stairs and balanced a table against it. You’ll
hear it fall if she tries to push the door open. Only way she can get
down is by the main stairway out here. Don’t think she’d care to try a
window.”

Haworth was so amazed he couldn’t speak.

“You must see what this means to our end of it,” Pentecost went on.
“We’ve got to put up big money in advance and incur enormous expenses
before there’s any return, and here’s this old lady in a position to
wreck the whole damned layout if she can get her nose into it—and
that’s what she’s working for.”

“What—what do you want me to do?”

“Keep her out of the house until the machine’s delivered.”

The young man was silent, staring uneasily before him. In a moment or
two Pentecost resumed: “I admire that old lady and I’ve got things laid
out for her later where she’ll come in delightfully. But for eleven
days she’ll have to disappear—or we must. It’s one or the other, Mr.
Haworth. We can’t risk money on a chance like that.”

Haworth nodded. “I’ll attend to it!” he said, hoarsely.

“Right. And there’s only one thing more to speak of—the butler.”

“Butler——” Haworth repeated, surprised.

“The old lady’s going. You ought to have some one here to attend to
you. Also, we’d like a man in the house to look out for our interests.
Why not combine the two? A butler—a general servant—who’ll take care
of you, and on our side see that no one tampers with the lock of that
small room in the basement, and a few little things like that.”

“Will you send some one?”

“Not quite that, Mr. Haworth. I know just the man for the job, but I’d
like you to get him yourself and leave us out of it.”

“But I—I don’t know. I never had any experience in——”

“Perfectly easy to manage. This young butler I speak of is booked with
a first-class employment agency on Forty-fifth Street.”

“New York?”

“Yes, West Forty-fifth. You can write them to send him over. Fellow’s
name is Dreek—James Dreek—and if he isn’t out on a job they’ll put him
on the next train.” (Pentecost very well knew “James Dreek” wasn’t out
on any job, though not from the employment agency, with which concern
he’d been more than careful never to have any dealings whatever.)
“Dreek can manage the whole place for you—see that our side of it is
protected at the same time.” He got out a pocketbook and took a card
from it. “Here we are; this is the agency.”

“But I——What shall to say to this—this agency?”

“Here, I’ll do it for you and you can sign it. Got a machine here?
Typewriter?”

Haworth shook his head.

“Oh well, wait. Sign your name at the bottom of a blank sheet and I’ll
type a letter in above it when I get back to the hotel.”

For some reason Haworth trusted this man implicitly, and after writing
his name at the bottom of a blank sheet, held it out to him. But
Pentecost didn’t take it.

“Haven’t you got a large envelope or something I can put it in?” he
asked. “Just to keep it clean till I get to the hotel?”

“I’m afraid not,” said Haworth, looking about on the table.

“Couldn’t you slip it into that large flat book there?”

“Why no! that’s my——Oh!” He seemed to recollect something and opened
the book, which was an illustrated catalogue of machinists’ tools, and
placed the sheet of paper on which he’d written, between the leaves.

“Shove an envelope with it, there’s a good fellow. The kind you use for
letters.”

Haworth did this and passed the book to Pentecost, who thus got the
stationery he wanted without touching it himself or having anyone else
touch it after it left Haworth’s hands.

Pentecost said, as he and the two Harkers were preparing to go: “Keep
it from the old lady that Dreek comes here on our recommendation.”

“I will,” said Haworth.

“We’re coming back in ten days—expiration of option you know—and can
take delivery at that time if the machine’s ready by then.”

“It’s ready now.”

Pentecost looked at him with a peculiar glint in his droop-lidded eyes.

“Then you plan to make delivery on that date?” he asked.

“My God, yes! if I’ve got to wait that long!”

Pentecost regarded the young man absently for an instant, then, with
the Harkers, turned away, and the three went down the steps to the
waiting taxi.

       *       *       *       *       *

The firm, with Alfred, had a late luncheon at the hotel, and then
Pentecost left the others and walked a few blocks—or what would have
been a few blocks in a rectangular city—to one of the largest dealers
in “rebuilt” typewriting machines. He asked to see some of the less
expensive models, and the salesman brought several, placing them on a
table along the side of the wall of the showroom. As it was a busy
hour, he left Pentecost to try the lot at his leisure, and went to the
customers who were waiting to be served.

Pentecost sat down and began trying the machines in a manner indicating
to anyone who noticed that he was somewhat of a novice. But though he
was awkward and slow, it didn’t take him long to discover which of the
three instruments displayed the most irregularities in its output; and
thereupon he quietly gave it a few extra characteristics, slightly
bending a couple of the type bars and filing away a part of two or
three of the printing faces with the nail blade of his pocket knife.
After a sharp glance about the place to assure himself that he wasn’t
under observation, he took the signed sheet of paper and envelope from
the large thin book in which Haworth had placed them, handling these
things with small pieces of blotting-paper folded once and slipped over
the edges, so that for the second time that day he avoided contact with
them.

The sheet of paper was thus inserted in the machine he had selected
(and doctored), and he proceeded to type a letter on it in the space
above Haworth’s signature. His inexperience with the typewriting
business was still in evidence, for he was constantly stopping to erase
or print over, or forgetting to shift for the next line.

There’s only time to give you an example, here and there, of this man’s
extraordinary methods of constructing his defenses. He worked far
deeper than along the line of the obvious, for his highest satisfaction
was to put up barriers against what had never been thought of by police
departments, but which he conceived as possible.

After finishing the letter, addressing the envelope, sealing it and
affixing a postage stamp by the same blotting-paper method of handling
(the moistening of stamp and envelope being his only “touchdowns”—but
no system of tongue-prints has as yet been devised), he bought the
machine he had been using for nineteen dollars, and took it with him.
The sealed letter he had slipped into a larger envelope, again making
use of the blotting-paper hold.

Walking to the corner of Court and Sudbury Streets, which wasn’t far,
he stopped and, taking out his handkerchief, mopped at his left eye,
as if he’d got a cinder in it. At once a man who had been following
came and stood at the corner near, but without giving any sign of
recognition. It was a busy corner, so that a man more or less stopping
there wouldn’t attract attention. Even at that early stage a “trusty”
was on the job in case anyone was putting a shadow on him.

The signal was “all clear,” and Pentecost turned west and strolled up
beyond the State House to Bullfinch Place. His man, following, joined
him in this quiet neighborhood.

Pentecost put the large envelope in his hands.

“Letter inside, stamped and addressed. Get it into the nearest letter
box to the house and before eight to-night,” he said, speaking rapidly.
“And _keep your hands off it_. Rip open the outside envelope, and let
the one inside slide into the box. Here’s a typewriter in this package;
take it out and polish it up. Clean all the marks off it. Wrap it up
again without touching it. Do you get that? If you put one finger on
it after you polish it off it’s you for the chair. The machine’s for
Haworth. Take it to him yourself. Tell him I thought he might like to
learn to use it. You stand by and get him to try it—tell him you’ve got
to change it if not satisfactory. I want his hands on it.”

“I get you!”

And the two sauntered carelessly away in different directions.

       *       *       *       *       *

When the firm of Harker & Pentecost, together with the son of the
senior partner, boarded the _North Land_ late that afternoon for the
return trip to New York, they greeted their steamer acquaintances of
the previous night pleasantly, though in a manner indicating that
they’d had a rather strenuous day of it. Mr. Pentecost alluded to his
intention of turning in early. Alfred was introduced to the purser and
one or two others as occasion arose, and the three were about for a
while, chatting with one and another of the officers.

Beside the Messrs. Harker & Pentecost and Alfred, there were two men
on board the _North Land_ who were closely associated with the firm,
although giving no evidence thereof. Their business on this trip was to
make close observation of certain points and circumstances connected
with the steamer and its crew, particularly in the passage through the
canal and the docking of the boat on reaching New York the following
morning; which business was faithfully attended to, as was also the
matter of their making the reservation of the two cabins they were
occupying on this voyage for the trip out of Boston ten days later, so
that the firm should have no appearance whatever in that transaction,
these rooms being 202 and 204 on the hurricane deck—the name of which
tends to foster the idea that it was high up among the clouds, whereas
there were two decks above it, the promenade and the boat.

The firm members made not the slightest effort to push themselves;
they were seen here and there; and after an early dinner together,
Pentecost, passing the pilot house, greeted Captain Snow, and the two
exchanged a few words through the open window. He very soon left,
saying he was going to bed, but hoped to be on board a week later, as
he had further business in Boston about then.

Instead, however, of turning in, he slipped down to the fantail, a
small deck at the stern just below the promenade. Passengers seldom
went there—and, indeed, weren’t allowed on that deck while the steamer
was docking or leaving, for the crew worked from there, and it was
cumbered with hawsers and chains, capstans, bitts, and other machinery
for handling the ship. When she was under way, however, the chains
across the passage were taken down. One of his men was on the fantail
when Pentecost got there, but no sign of recognition passed between
them. The other man was in the forward part of the boat, moving
unobtrusively about to see where officers and crew were stationed as
the steamer negotiated the canal, which she was about to do. Both men
on the fantail made the closest observations possible as she slid
quietly through, the passage occupying something like thirty-five
minutes, for they had her down to less than half speed. It was dusky
twilight when the _North Land_ entered the canal, and quite dark as she
emerged at the other end. And when she _did_ emerge and swung out into
the shimmering and light-dotted open of Buzzards Bay, Pentecost went at
once to his cabin, slipping forward by the outside starboard passage,
to the door of the saloon lobby, and from there up the stairway to the
promenade deck, thus keeping it nicely in the shade as to what part of
the ship he’d come from.

The week that followed was one of hard work for Mr. Pentecost,
arranging for the execution of his extraordinary plan of
campaign—assembling the parts, as you might say, arranging for “the
market” in most of the large cities, instructing his men, and all the
while perfecting his defensive system to cover any possible contingency.

For Haworth, after he had finished with the very painful task of asking
old Mrs. Temple to remain away from the house until the machine he’d
sold was crated and taken away, the waiting wasn’t so hard as it had
been, for now he was uplifted by the realization that at last he’d be
able to come to the rescue of the one who was dearer to him than his
life.

       *       *       *       *       *

Early one evening, soon after the Harker & Pentecost visit I’ve just
been telling you about, he went to see her. He’d been keeping away for
weeks—months, it seemed to him—in order to spare her the trying ordeal
with Augustus—his drunken and bestial abuse, his threats of violence,
that were sure to follow his visits. But now he wanted her to have the
comfort of knowing that help was coming—that it would be here in a few
days. And it was something he wanted to say to her in person—say with
his mouth and lips and eyes and heart and entire being—not convey in
the form of a letter, a cold series of words which in themselves meant
next to nothing. Making as sure as possible of a time when Findlay
wasn’t there or likely to be, he went to the little cottage.

It was a precious visit for them both, though her cough and emaciation
and strange pallor with the feverish scarlet flush made his heart stop
beating when he first saw her. But it was from that—from the terrible
thing it meant—that he could now be the one to save her. And he told
her about the invention he was going to sell for a great deal of money,
and how after that everything would be done for her—everything—the most
wonderful medical care and the most beneficial place in the world. He
was magnificently happy in telling her this, and she was quietly elated
with him, rejoicing to the utmost of her small strength. But before her
happiness could be completed she had to ask if he would be with her,
and be made confident that he would. He assured her that it was so,
that though he might not be able to go with her when she went, because
of the business he would have to finish up, he would come as soon as he
could possibly do it—the very minute he could get away.

       *       *       *       *       *

The steamer _North Land_ upon which the Messrs. Harker & Pentecost
had already made two trips—one over and one back—made fast to the
India wharf in Boston on the tenth morning after their former visit to
Haworth, which brought it to the 30th day of August—the expiration date
of the option. The voyage had been quiet and uneventful, the partners
not pushing themselves in the least, though enjoying brief chats with
some of the officers and having cigars with Captain Snow and one or two
others in his cabin after dinner.

When they were asked how it was coming out about the invention they
were trying to get hold of—the one they’d referred to on the last trip
over—Mr. Pentecost gave them some further particulars about young
Haworth and his extraordinary genius; and as there seemed to be quite
a little interest in the matter, he briefly described what it was they
were trying to get hold of—a combination gas and compressed-air engine.
He spoke, too, of an idea they had of trying to get the young inventor
on a contract to work under their direction for five years.

Alfred was waiting for them at the hotel (the one at which they
stopped before), having, as he had on the former visit, come over
by a night train. A heavy mail awaited the firm at the office, with
several telegrams from various places and two or three large envelopes
registered, all of which had been attended to by Miss Dugas, their
office stenographer, who had notified the “correspondents” (as you
might call them) in various cities to send letters and telegrams to
Boston as per instructions; and because you know the letters and
telegrams so sent were bogus, the trick being one among many items
in Pentecost’s establishment of their “open work” presence in town,
it needn’t lead you to imagine that a single envelope of the lot
contained only blank paper. Each one had in it an apparently important
business communication relating to one of the three or four legitimate
promotions that the firm operated as decoys; and if traced to its
source a man or woman would be found who was trying to buy stock in one
of their straight companies, or wanting an agency, or with an invention
to sell, or that sort of thing. Pentecost left two or three of the best
of these letters lying about the room for the chambermaid to turn in
at the hotel office when he left. Also, he went to the hotel telegraph
desk and asked for a repeat on one of his wires.

After breakfast in the restaurant the three men retired to their room
and went into a low-voiced conference for perhaps half an hour.

Then Pentecost went down to the hotel desk, there making inquiry
as to a reliable trucking concern that could handle a heavy piece
of machinery he wanted hauled from West Roxbury to one of the
freight stations for Jersey City. Proceeding by taxi to one that the
information clerk looked up for him, he arranged for one of their heavy
trucks and a moving apparatus and plenty of men to call for the machine
on the following day, giving them an order on Haworth and full shipping
instructions. Having done this, he rejoined the Harkers.

And about twenty minutes before eleven the three came out of the hotel
and, entering a large car which had been waiting for them, were driven
away. No slipping out on the quiet. All open and aboveboard.

Harker rang the bell at the mansion, and James Dreek opened the door.
He was an ideal servant in both appearance and behavior. When Harker
inquired if Mr. Haworth was at home, Dreek asked what names he should
give, and upon being told—with the further information that they’d come
by appointment—he begged pardon and showed them in at once, saying Mr.
Haworth was expecting them.

The great entrance hall showed a marked change since their visit of
ten days before. Several worn chairs stood about and a long table was
pushed up against the north wall—doubtless stuff that wouldn’t sell and
had been stored in other rooms or the attic. But the most noticeable
thing in the place was a huge edifice in the form of a crate, measuring
something like five feet in height. Between the slats and timbers of
this enormous cage could be seen machinery of heavy build, and such
parts as were discernible plainly indicated to a person of sufficient
mechanical enlightenment that it was an engine of some kind.

Pentecost walked over to the great slatted box and glanced at what
was visible within, then followed the two others of his party, who
had gone into the room on the left,—the door of which James Dreek was
holding open for him.

Haworth was shaking hands with Harker and Alfred as he entered, and he
did the same with Pentecost as he approached; and as the latter asked
him how he was feeling, the faint smile that meant so much lighted his
face for an instant as he answered in a low voice, “Rather worn-out
waiting, Mr. Pentecost.”

“We had to take all the time the option allowed us, Mr. Haworth, but
we’re here within the limit and can go on whenever you say the word.”

“Consider the word said,” was Haworth’s quiet answer.

Upon which Mr. Harker took the papers from a document case and tossed
them on the table.

The contract, though not long, took some little time to go through,
for Harker was at pains to explain each point; and you could see that
Haworth was growing restless and was eager to come to the clause
dealing with the amount of money which the firm was to pay him.

When Harker—it was toward the end—read out that the amount to be paid
to the party of the first part upon the signing of this contract was
the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, and was going on with slight
acceleration of speed to the next clause, Haworth said, very quietly:
“Wait a minute, please. That’s a mistake.”

“Mistake? How so?” from Harker—simulating surprise.

“You said fifteen thousand. It should be forty-five.”

What might be called a telling pause followed, the idea being that the
partners were struck dumb with astonishment.

“Forty-five what?” Harker finally managed to inquire.

“Thousand,” Haworth answered in his gentle voice.

“Where in God’s name did you get the notion that we are going to give
you such a figure as that? Why you’re crazy! We never agreed to any
such ridiculous price—never in this world!”

“Excuse me. Your partner”—indicating Pentecost—“said the amount would
be one that was satisfactory to me. That’s the one that is. I’ve found
I need it.”

“Mr. Haworth”—Harker spoke with quiet and pleading earnestness—“let’s
be reasonable about this. The amount you name is far beyond what we’re
able to pay. We couldn’t touch it. If that’s the figure you’re going
to insist on, it’s only a dirty waste of time for us to go on talking.
We’re through—and the whole thing stops right here!”

“No—it doesn’t stop! I know the idea’s good—you wouldn’t be here if it
wasn’t—and if you can’t give me as much as that, I can find someone who
will!”

The two super-sharps of the firm, born gamblers both, were entirely
aware that Haworth meant precisely what he said, no thought of bluffing
having a place in his system. They argued about it for some little
time—which is to say, Harker did, for Haworth said nothing, merely
shaking his head a little now and then in refusal of some offer or
suggestion; and when Harker, driven to his last play, stated that all
the money they’d brought with them was twenty-five thousand, the young
man merely asked him how long it would take to get the rest.

“Then you won’t accept this twenty-five?” Harker’s tone had now a
definite finality in it, carrying the idea that he was giving Haworth
his last chance. But the young man shook his head again.

It was here that Pentecost, who hadn’t joined in the discussion,
came forward. He said he had one proposal to make. It was quite true
the firm had brought only twenty-five thousand, but he himself had
in his possession the sum of ten thousand, which he’d intended using
in the liquidation of a stock transaction. But he was so anxious to
have the deal go through that he would add this ten thousand to the
firm’s twenty-five, and they would then be able to offer Mr. Haworth
thirty-five thousand in cash, and in addition to that would agree to
pay him or whomsoever he might designate as his agent, an amount equal
to one-fifth of whatever profit they were able to make on the handling
of the enterprise.

I’m giving you this little episode in some detail because it was
certainly odd to see such a simple, almost childlike person as
Charles Michael Haworth putting it all over a brace of about the most
consummate swindlers that ever adorned the criminal contingent, and
doing it without an idea that he was making any play at all.

As to this new proposition of accepting one-fifth share of the profits
in place of ten thousand of the cash price which he had fixed upon, he
considered it a few moments and then turned to Pentecost.

“Will you attend to this yourself?” he asked.

“Yes—I will.”

The young man sat looking steadily at Mr. Pentecost for some little
time, his calm penetrating gaze seeming to search for something. Then
he turned away and indicated that he would agree to the arrangement
proposed.

Harker had been fuming to himself over his partner’s enormous offer,
but Pentecost, with a peculiar twist of his hand as he looked at his
wrist watch, put it across to him that the game was so fixed they
couldn’t lose. Harker’s experience with this same signal in former
operations led him to infer that it didn’t matter what they paid, as
they’d get it back. He took out his fountain pen and wrote into the
contract the thirty-five thousand and the one-fifth share of profits.

After both parties to the agreement had duly written their names, James
Dreek was called in to sign as one witness, with Alfred Harker as the
other, thus making the thing complete and duly executed. It was in
duplicate—one copy for Haworth, the other for the firm.

After the signing, with only a wait until Dreek had left the room,
Mr. Harker, with some difficulty, got out the bunch of money from the
document case and passed it over to Alfred. At the same time Pentecost
approached the table, and saying, “There’s mine,” tossed a roll of
bills on it. This payment in cash had been insisted on by Haworth from
the very beginning.

Alfred counted out the thirty-five thousand, which was in century
notes, on the table. The separate piles of a thousand each were deftly
stacked in one, and this was pushed nonchalantly across the table to
Haworth. He fussed with it rather helplessly a moment.

“Like to have ’em riffled again with the brakes on?” Alfred was an
expert bill shifter and had snapped ’em off like the flutter of a
humming bird’s wings.

“Yes, please.” Haworth watched intently while the lightfingered youth
dealt each bill off the pack so slowly and carefully that it could be
seen and noted as it fell on the pile before him.

When the recount was finished, Haworth muttered a “thank you,” and
signed the receipt which Harker, mumbling something about its being “a
cash transaction, you know,” pushed over to him.

At that moment, Pentecost, turning from the money count, caught sight
of James Dreek going through the swing door into the butler’s pantry at
the farther end of the room.

“How the hell did _he_ get here?” Pentecost demanded in a sharp,
rasping whisper the instant the door swung to.

“Who?” Haworth asked with a glance about.

“That young butler of yours. He had his lamps on that stack of yellows
on the table.”

“You got him in yourself,” Haworth answered, “to sign as a witness.”

“He went out again!” (Still in the guttural whisper.) “We waited for
that before we slid the boodle out on the table.”

“You said he was all right, didn’t you?”

“All the same, you want to be a little careful with that bunch of
money!” And he moved noiselessly to the door which had closed after
Dreek’s exit, and listened with his ear close against it.

Appearing to be no more than half satisfied, he returned to the others
and for an hour they discussed various points such as Haworth’s wishes
regarding future payments, the taking of the machine the next day by
the trucking firm, and the actual time of what was referred to by them
as “delivery of the goods.” These things settled, Pentecost expressed
the wish to take a look around the basement. Haworth went with him to
the place where the planked-up room had been. Not only was it no longer
there, but no evidence existed of its having been there. The timbers
and flooring above the place where it had been built in showed no nail
marks or abrasions of any kind and were grimy and darkened by age.

Having examined the place and its vicinity with the utmost care, using
for this the small electric torch he always carried, Pentecost led the
way into what had been the machine shop, and closed the door. There he
went over several important matters which he preferred to discuss with
Haworth alone. They conversed earnestly for a while, and then left the
basement together by the door opening to stone steps leading up to the
grounds at the rear of the house.

Mr. Pentecost made a surreptitious examination of this door and the
route by which they reached it, while Haworth was setting the lamp on
the cellar stairs, after extinguishing it. The two then went out to the
old barn not far in the rear, and looked about there for a while. After
that they went toward the house again.

Haworth had been carrying the big bunch of money in his clothes all
this while, part in one pocket and part in another, and Pentecost,
appearing to notice this for the first time, begged him to go in and
put it somewhere where it would be safe. He said he’d walk about a bit
for the air and would be with him in a few minutes. So Haworth left him
and went in.

Pentecost now gave the house (outside) and its surroundings his full
attention, especially as to the windows of the room on the left with
their vine-covered shutters, and the character of the ground and
shrubbery beneath them. It took him but a few moments to get all the
information he needed as to the walls and foundation and roof overhang,
together with other details that might come in, and lastly he took a
look at the great elm trees in front and the “lay” of the ground in the
rear.

He reëntered the house by the basement door through which he and
Haworth had come out, and James Dreek was waiting for him in a corner
of the cellar.

“Old woman?” Pentecost asked in a whisper.

“Outside,” was the answer. “Watches all day from a distance. Nights in
the bushes close under the side windows.”

“We can use her!” And he gave Dreek whispered directions, after which
he rejoined the others in the room on the left.

Harker and Alfred were ready to go—indeed eager to, for it hadn’t been
an easy quarter of an hour for them. They rose rather suddenly when
Pentecost came in, and the three moved toward the door murmuring the
ordinary phrases of leave-taking.

Haworth had taken the bulky bunches of money out of his pockets and put
them together on the table, and as Pentecost and the two Harkers saw
him last he was standing there with one hand resting on them. He made
no move to go with them to the door.

       *       *       *       *       *

Besides the Messrs. Harker & Pentecost and Alfred, there were on board
the steamer _North Land_ when she left the India wharf that same
afternoon, a number of persons who were more or less concerned in
the business of the firm, yet, as you need hardly be told, giving no
indication that such was the case. Not only were cabins 202 and 204 on
the hurricane deck occupied by Pentecost’s men as before, but 200, 201,
203, and 205 were also held, though only two of these were occupied.
Thus, if you should happen to examine a chart of the boat, you would
see that the firm commanded both port and starboard approaches to the
fantail.

And also as on the return voyage eight days before, the partners
appeared to be pretty well fagged out, although it didn’t prevent their
being about for a while and chatting pleasantly with their steamer
acquaintances, letting it be known (but not until inquiry was made)
that they’d succeeded in purchasing the rights to the extraordinary
device of which they’d spoken, and what was more, had got a contract
with the young inventor himself giving them his services for five years.

Again they had an early dinner together in the restaurant and sat on
the boat deck for a while, smoking cigars. Along toward half-past seven
or a quarter to eight they sauntered forward, pausing at the large
windows of the pilot house and greeting the captain. He asked them to
come in and have a look at the canal—which the steamer was even then
slowing down to enter. They accepted the invitation, and sat watching
the shores on each side until it grew so dark—for the night was
overcast—that only faint and blurred outlines could be distinguished.

Some ten or twelve minutes before they reached the western end of the
canal, Pentecost rose lazily, made an effort to conceal a yawn, and
bade the captain good night. He was rather done up with the day in
Boston, he said, and really couldn’t keep his eyes open any longer.
Having thus excused himself, he went below, leaving Harker there to
see the ship come out into the Bay, which he claimed to be desirous of
doing.

Shortly after this the steamer slid silently by the village of Buzzards
Bay, its many lights twinkling about a mile to the north, for it
wasn’t situated directly on the canal; and a little later passed out
into the open waters of the Bay itself; and on that, in obedience to
the “full speed ahead” ring from the wheel-house, broke into her normal
stride again, heading out toward Block Island Sound.

About this time, when the _North Land_ had been clear of the canal for
something like eight or ten minutes, Mr. Harker’s attention appeared to
be suddenly arrested by something below on the forward deck.

“Well, doesn’t that beat the——” He broke off and stood staring down.

“Anything wrong?”

“Not exactly wrong—only he was telling us just now he was so completely
done up he’d got to go to bed!”

“Your partner, you mean?”

“Yes, Pentecost! And now he’s gone into conference with a young lady!
Over there on the left. See?”

Harker was pointing to a man near the port rail, whose back was turned
to them and who was in animated conversation with a person who, in the
dim light, appeared to be an attractive young lady.

Captain Snow laughed a little.

“So he has,” he said. “Well, it’s never too late for that!”

“There’s truth in what you say,” Harker admitted, and thereupon changed
the subject. “New Bedford light we see over there?” he asked.

“No. That’s Bird Island. Five points starboard.”

“What’s that one you’re aiming for?”

“Dead ahead you mean?”

“Yes.”

“That’s a fairway buoy—Buzzards Bay Buoy they call it. We change the
course there for Nigger Ledge.”

Most likely you picked it up when I mentioned that it was only the
back of the gentleman on the forward deck that could be seen from the
pilot house, and naturally it was the said back that resembled Mr.
Harker’s partner; and that was all that did. The man wasn’t Pentecost
at all, for the good and sufficient reason that that gentleman had
jumped off the steamer fifteen minutes before. It was one of his gang
of “trusties,” brought along for the purpose, with about the same build
as himself, entirely similar hat and clothing, and well matched hair
and back of head, so far as could be seen. The young woman with him was
Miss Mary Finch Dugas, their office stenographer, who was occasionally
sent out on an operation where the utmost precaution was necessary.

       *       *       *       *       *

A short time before the _North Land_, gliding noiselessly at about
fifty-five turns (less than half speed) through the still waters of the
canal, reached the vicinity of Buzzards Bay village, (which is at the
farther end of it as you go from Boston) Mr. Pentecost had left the
pilot house in the manner described to you a moment ago, gone below to
the hurricane deck, and hurried aft on the starboard outside passageway
until he reached the fantail deck at the stern. Alfred was waiting for
him there in the dark. He had fixed a knotted rope so that it hung
over the stern rail nearly to the water, the upper end made fast to a
stanchion.

The two waited silently in the gloom until they could hear the raucous
clanging of the warning bell on the drawbridge, which commenced its
clatter when the great draw swung up into the air, and kept it going
until it was down in place again. This was the Bourne highway bridge
and in a couple of minutes the steamer was passing through. A moment
after that, while the bell was still ringing and the passengers on the
decks above watching the draw slowly descend, Pentecost, who had hold
of the rope, clambered over the rail and lowered himself to the level
of the main deck, which was the next one below. This deck was closed in
at the stern, but he got a foothold on the ribbon piece and from there
let himself down into the water without the least noise. It was so
quiet, with the steamer slipping along at scarcely more than steerage
way, that a splash might have attracted attention if the bell on the
draw should stop ringing. The overhang of the counter made him safe
from the propellers, and the water kicked up by them amounted to very
little. He was whirled around two or three times, but it didn’t even
duck him. A few strokes brought him to shore. But he didn’t come up
on the banks till the _North Land_ was going through the draw of the
railroad bridge, a little further on, for there were lights along the
shore of the canal, and he wasn’t taking any chances.

Coming up on the low flat that bordered the waterway at this place,
he quickly found the marks of an old road through it, and followed
this with the aid of his flashlight which he quickly undid from its
waterproof wrappings. He hardly needed it though, as of course he’d
been over every inch of the ground. Coming to the embankment of the
bridge approach, he still kept to the cart tracks which turned along
the side of the embankment and then climbed it, bringing him out on the
Bourne Road at a point nearly opposite the Soldier’s Monument.

Pentecost stood there a moment, dripping with water, and looking
sharply down the road. It was hardly thirty seconds before a large
closed car hove in sight, coming rapidly up the slope toward the
bridge. A white handkerchief fluttered for an instant from the
right-hand rear window (behind the driver), and instantly Pentecost ran
out in the road and, waving his own handkerchief, signaled the car to
stop. As soon as the car came to a standstill Pentecost called out to
the driver, begging pardon for delaying him, etc., but stating that he
was in a desperate hurry to get to Boston and asking if he could tell
him where there was a garage. The chauffeur told him there was one on
the right as he went toward the village—some distance up the road.

At this point the man in the car, who’d been listening to the talk and
also regarding Pentecost with what appeared to be astonishment (the
road was well lighted here), opened the door and asked if there’d been
an accident.

“Not at all,” said Pentecost; “that is, I did take a tumble into the
water. But that’s of no consequence. My trouble is to get to Boston in
the shortest possible time—life and death matter—I’ll try the garage up
the road—and thank you very much.”

“Why see here!” called out the stranger as he climbed out of the car.
“You take this machine—just came down in it from Boston—my place in
Bourne—across the bridge—walk it in six minutes!... You’ll take him
back won’t you?” addressing the man at the wheel. And then to Pentecost
as he passed close to him and put something in his hand while he
continued speaking, “It’s a hired car you know—he’s got to go back
anyway!”

The matter was quickly arranged, and the driver stimulated toward
doing his best in the way of speed by the promise of a quite enormous
bonus if he made it inside of eighty minutes.

You may as well know (perhaps you’ve already guessed it) that this
was one of Pentecost’s men who hired the car in Boston and came down
in it to Buzzards Bay, waiting in the village on some pretext until
the _North Land_ reached the railroad bridge over the canal, and then
starting for the highway bridge where Pentecost was to stop him. It
was a crumpled wad of paper he’d put into Pentecost’s hand, with the
number 2026 written on it—the same being the number of the chauffeur’s
operating license.

The chauffeur, on the other hand, was a stranger. This for reasons
that’ll come in later. I can say this now,—that he earned the bonus
offered for speed; they were negotiating the streets of Jamaica Plain
in a trifle under the seventy-five minutes. Pentecost stopped him at
the corner of Centre and Greenough Streets, and after settling the bill
and the bonus, turned east and walked rapidly up Greenough. As soon,
however, as the sound of the car assured him that it was at a safe
distance, he retraced his steps and kept on to the west or southwest,
eventually coming to a little-used lane well beyond Torrington Road,
from which, by crossing a long-abandoned vegetable garden, he could
approach the Cripps mansion from the rear.

       *       *       *       *       *

And now, just so you can keep the run of things as they come along, I’m
going back a few days in order to show you how it happened that old
Mrs. Temple was concealed in the bushes under one of the windows of the
room on the left, at the very moment that Hugo Pentecost, after his
plunge from the steamer into the Cape Cod Canal and the rapid drive in
an automobile to the Roxbury district of Boston, was cautiously making
his way toward the rear of the mansion.

The old woman had been greatly relieved to notice a striking
improvement in Mr. Haworth’s condition almost immediately after the
first visit of Mr. Pentecost to the house, although she feared it was
due to trickery by which the scoundrel (which she was sure he was)
would in some way do him injury. The doctor she’d left word for at the
drug store called the same evening and said there was nothing seriously
wrong with him, and did no more than prescribe a tonic, nourishing
food, and a complete rest.

As the days passed and nothing transpired, Mrs. Temple felt less and
less uneasiness, and it was nearly a week before things began to happen
that revived her anxiety. They began on the morning of the fifth day
after the Pentecost visit, and the first of them was the sending of her
by Mr. Haworth on a most unusual errand—one that took her to some sort
of foundry place in East Boston. And he told her if they didn’t have
the kind of pulley wheel described in his letter, she must wait until
they could get it for her.

Her smoldering suspicions instantly burst into flame, yet she couldn’t
refuse to go.

It was a long journey and her imaginings of what might befall Mr.
Haworth while she was away came near to making her turn back without
doing the errand at all. She finally reached the office of the foundry
and delivered the letter, but when they told her that they hadn’t the
pulley wheel there but would send to the warehouse for it, she answered
without an instant’s hesitation that she couldn’t wait, but would come
another time. The men in the office called her attention to the fact
that Mr. Haworth had said in the letter that she would wait for the
pulley.

“Well, I ain’t a-goin’ to!” she muttered hurriedly as she disappeared
through the door.

Arriving home something like an hour later, Mrs. Temple approached the
mansion from the rear. She had worked herself into a frenzy of fear
that Mr. Haworth was in danger, and she wanted to investigate without
being seen. Finding herself at last in one of the rear passages of the
house, she stood listening. Low voices could be heard from somewhere in
the front.

With the utmost caution she made her way across the kitchen and through
the butler’s pantry to the swing door opening into the room on the
left. But the conversation within suddenly ceased and she began a hasty
retreat. Hearing the door she’d just left swing open again (it had a
very decided creak) she made for the servants’ stairway—which opened
off the kitchen.

There was a door at the bottom of these stairs which Mrs. Temple
hastily closed after her as she fled, and when she paused at the
top she heard the thud of heavy objects being shoved against it and
realized that she was trapped; for the only other way down was the main
stairway to the entrance hall, which was in plain sight if anyone took
the trouble to look. And she very well knew that some one would take
that trouble. She’d heard his voice in the room on the left in the
brief second she was at the swing door.

So she’d have to stay there until the gang of criminals and thugs, as
she classified the men in the front room with Haworth, was gone. She
brought a chair to the top of the main stairway and sat there, ready at
the first alarming sound to rush down and fight like a wildcat, or run
for the police, or do anything to rescue and protect the one to whom
she was so desperately devoted. But no cry of distress reached her—only
the low murmur of subdued voices.

It was early afternoon (she’d been waiting somewhere near two hours)
when she saw the men come out into the entrance hall below her. There
were three of them—the Pentecost creature with two confederates. Of
course they were confederates. What else could they be?

Haworth came out with them. She heard the taxi the men had waiting for
them drive away, and she saw Mr. Haworth return to the room on the
left. At this she crept noiselessly down the main stairway and back
through the rear hall. But she’d hardly more than reached the kitchen
when Haworth came in through the butler’s pantry and stopped at the
door.

“Oh, you came back?” he said.

“I hope ye ain’t a-goin’ ter take it hard, Mr. Haworth,” the old woman
begged, “but I couldn’t no more wait there an’ you left here alone with
them thugs or card sharps or whatever they be, than I could fly! I knew
they’d be comin’ the minute ye sent me away like that an’ told me to
wait—an’ how could I, Mr. Haworth—how could I stay settin’ there in
that factory place, not knowin’ what might be happenin’ to ye?”

“No matter, Mrs. Temple.”

“Yes, Mr. Haworth, that was all; an’ I was worryin’ the life clean out
o’ me. Terrible warn’t no name fur it! I couldn’t tell ye!”

“You did it for me, Mrs. Temple, and you’ve always been doing things
for me. Please don’t think I haven’t noticed.”

The old woman’s trembling hand made two or three fumbles for her apron
before she realized that she wasn’t wearing one, and a tear or two ran
unmolested down her withered cheek.

“And—I—I’ve got to ask you,” he went on, hesitatingly (and then came
another of the frightful things that were to alarm her on this fearsome
day)—“I’ve got to ask you to do something more for me, Mrs. Temple.”

She looked up, staring at him with apprehension in her tear-wet eyes.
And he went on to tell her how it seemed best that she should stay away
from the house for a few days—just until one of his inventions was
crated and out of the way—something very important that had to be kept
secret, as there was no patent—so just a few days——

“Mr. Haworth,” she interrupted, “do please listen to me! Ye mustn’t
have no more to do with them creatures. They ain’t right, Mr. Haworth;
they’re crooked an’ treach’rous, every one o’ ’em—awful men! That
Pentecost, he wouldn’t stop at nothin’—nothin’ in the world! Don’t let
’em in here again—don’t do it, Mr. Haworth! I beg ye won’t do it!”

“But I must, Mrs. Temple. They’ve bought one of my machines.”

The old woman was struck silent for an instant.

“Be they goin’ to pay ye money for it?”

“Yes.”

“You mean money right down?”

“Yes,—it’s got to be that way.”

A pause. Then: “Mr. Haworth, there’s some trick! Ef them jailbirds pay
you money down they’ll rob it away from ye! They’re a-goin’ to git you
some way—they wouldn’t be here if they wasn’t. I’ve seen spellbinders
like them be—yes, an’ had to do with ’em too! Don’t turn me away now.
Wait till after I’ve got ’em out an’ then I’ll go! Not now—not now, Mr.
Haworth. You ain’t no person to cope with such as them.”

The young man stood looking at Mrs. Temple’s face, unable to speak.
Suddenly he turned away and uttering a broken “I can’t—I can’t——You
must go!” he turned and fled from the room.

       *       *       *       *       *

For the following few days Mrs. Temple’s anxiety concerning the
unknown danger she considered Haworth to be in overshadowed the
lacerated feelings that naturally followed the poor soul’s expulsion
from the house. No particle of blame could attach to him, for was he
not under the malign influence of a gang of criminals and in no way
responsible for what he did? This she felt, and her heart harbored no
bitterness—though it had been cruelly hurt. She must find out in some
way what villainy these human sharks were planning, though for the
present nothing was possible but to keep close watch on the house.

The very next night after her dismissal by Mr. Haworth she saw a young
man who hadn’t been there before, emerge from the darkness into the
faint light that fell from a front window across the portico (she was
watching from behind bushes quite near), and after ringing the bell,
pass in at the front door. The roller shades—cheap affairs that the
second hand dealer had agreed to put in in place of the old velvet
curtains he was taking away—hadn’t been pulled down since she left, so
she could see in. The stranger was being shown about by Mr. Haworth,
who had evidently expected him, and seemed to be given charge of things
as though he was a servant. That was it! The scoundrels had got Mr.
Haworth to send her away and take a man in her place. So now they had a
confederate right there in the house with him!

The old woman, desperate in her helplessness, made up her mind to get
assistance. She’d go to the police in the morning and they’d arrest
this man. Wasn’t it their business to protect people? If not, what
_was_ their business, she’d like to know!

Early the next morning she hurried to the Jamaica Plain district, and
as soon as she saw a patrolman, plunged into an excited account of the
situation. But the old woman’s story seemed to border on the grotesque.
From what he could gather the officer figured that she’d lost her
job and they’d got a butler to take her place, with the result that
the poor creature had gone dotty about it, thinking the man was some
sort of a crook. He couldn’t find that she had any grounds for such a
suspicion, but to quiet her he took down the address and said he’d keep
an eye on the place. Mrs. Temple became almost hysterical, begging him
not to stop with just keepin’ an eye on it, but to come over an’ arrest
the man,—to please do _somethin’_ for mercy’s sake—if he didn’t there’d
be some terrible thing happenin’ to some one. But the patrolman told
her he couldn’t make an arrest until some crime or misdemeanor had been
committed. She finally realized that it was useless to waste further
time with him and hurried back to keep watch again from the outside,
and do what she could alone. That’s what she did from then on.

During the day she hung about at some distance, keeping herself well
out of sight, but always at places where she could see who entered
the mansion and who left it. When darkness set in she stole to some
overgrown shrubbery close to the house on the south side, and was able
to see what was happening within, if the lights were on.

For a week the old woman remained on watch until late at night and
returned to her vigil early in the morning, bringing with her in a
paper bag what little food she needed. During this time she saw Mr.
Haworth leave the place a number of times, which was a little unusual,
but he doubtless had business in town or elsewhere; also men having the
appearance of being mechanics drove up in a car one day and were in
the house until nearly five o’clock; and she discovered, on reaching
her nearer station in the evening, that a heavy piece of machinery was
standing crated in the great entrance hall, presumably having been
brought up from the basement. The butler fellow appeared to be taking
care of Mr. Haworth in a surprisingly competent manner. What a relief,
she thought, if the machine in the hall should be taken away and the
crooked gang that bought it never show up again!

       *       *       *       *       *

But this growing hopefulness on the part of Mrs. Temple served only to
make the shock more violent when, on the morning of the tenth day after
their former visit, the very bunch of swindlers she dreaded drove up
to the mansion and were admitted to the house. She had known it would
happen!

During the whole day, from the time they came, the old woman hardly
took her eyes off the mansion, not even for long enough to open the
little package of bread and cheese she’d brought. After they entered,
nothing more could be seen of them until early in the afternoon, when
Mr. Haworth appeared with Mr. Pentecost, walking around from the back
and going across to the old barn in the rear. After that she saw Mr.
Pentecost alone, making an examination of the windows, the grounds,
even the old elm trees near the house. He finally disappeared into the
mansion at one of the rear doors, and a short time after that the three
came out at the front portico and drove away in the big car which had
been waiting since their arrival in the morning.

The moment it was dark enough for her to approach the house she made
haste to her place among the tangled shrubbery close under the side
windows. The room on the left was absolutely dark, but by listening
intently she could hear voices in a further room, and it was an
unspeakable relief when she recognized Mr. Haworth’s among them. He
seemed to be giving directions to the young accomplice (there wasn’t a
doubt in her mind as to his being one) that the gang of scoundrels had
got into the house as a butler.

She’d been there but a short time, close under one of the side windows
of the room on the left, when the sound of carefully lightened
footsteps reached her ears. Soon the forms of two men could be made
out in the darkness coming along the flagged path from the rear and
passing quite near her as they went toward the front of the house. They
appeared to be carrying some heavy object and went around the corner
with it to the front.

Mrs. Temple crawled cautiously through the high weeds and bushes to a
place where she could see them again and more distinctly, for the light
was on in the big entrance hall, and struck through the two narrow
windows—one at each side of the door—across the front portico. This
with its columns reflected enough light to enable her to make out what
they were doing.

They had put a ladder (which must have been what they were carrying)
against the vine-covered wall at one side of the front window of the
room on the left, up which one of them had climbed, and were working
at something which seemed to be under the thick growth of creeper,
carefully disentangling the vines, unwinding, drawing out, and securing
them at one side, never cutting or breaking. The leaves in particular
they appeared to be handling with the utmost care, and it wasn’t until
they had slowly and with all possible precaution pulled one of the
window shutters out of the tangled mass that had covered it as it stood
opened back against the wall, that she suddenly realized what it all
meant.

They were closing the blinds! Closing them! Such a thing hadn’t
been done in all the years she’d been there! It could mean but one
thing—something was going to happen in the house that no one must see!
She was horrified, aghast, unable to move.

It took the men a long time to free both shutters and tie the vines
back so they’d be supported. But finally she saw they were coming down
and gathering up some cords and tools from the ground. It would be the
side windows next—the blinds there were open and overgrown in the same
way as the front one—and she’d be directly in their path as they came
around the corner. So she crawled out from among the bushes and hobbled
away a little distance in the darkness. Her rheumatism was bad from her
being out on the damp ground so much.

But the men didn’t stop at the side windows. Instead they went back to
the rear of the house, passing along the flagged path by which they
came, carrying the ladder and what tools they’d brought with them.

Shivering with dread, Mrs. Temple stood trying to think how she could
get word to Mr. Haworth—how warn him—put him on his guard? Though after
his telling her that she must not, she didn’t dare to go in, yet she
_would_ dare if there was no other way.

Before the poor old soul could decide what to do she heard the front
door of the house close heavily and saw someone coming down the steps.
As he turned at the bottom, the illumination from the hall windows fell
upon him, and she saw it was Haworth.

At once she determined to speak to him—to warn him of his danger—to beg
him to let her come into the house again so she could see that no harm
came to him. She said to herself that if he’d do that, she’d sleep in
front of his door at night—indeed, never let him out of her sight if
she could help it.

All this came to her while she was hurrying with all her strength to
overtake the young man as he went toward the gate; but he was walking
fast, and, crippled by rheumatism as she was, she couldn’t come up with
him. She called as loud as she dared—which was in a very subdued voice
indeed, as it wouldn’t do for that butler scoundrel to know that she
was warning him.

But Haworth either didn’t hear or wouldn’t stop; and finally, about
halfway down the drive, the old woman gave it up.

Then she decided to wait in the drive until his return; she could speak
to him there without disobeying his orders.

       *       *       *       *       *

A little time after Charles Haworth disappeared in the darkness,
leaving poor old Mrs. Temple standing in the driveway not far from
the gate, he and Edith were together in the small living room of
the Findlay cottage on Cherry Street. That afternoon about half-past
four, a stranger had called on Mrs. Findlay—a mild-looking middle-aged
man—and had told her that Mr. Haworth would be there that evening
between seven and eight.

Edith had hesitated, whereupon the stranger muttered in a low voice,
“Mr. Findlay won’t be home till quite late.”

“How—how do you know?” she asked.

“Some one’ll be taking him to supper, an’ they’re liable to be engaged
in conversation for some little time.”

Before she could make any reply the man was gone.

And now Haworth was there—with her.

For a long time they scarcely spoke. A few endearing words whispered as
they clung together—that was all.

Finally he lowered her hands from his lips, though still holding them.
“Darling one—you know it already—that I’ve come with good news—don’t
you?”

He could feel her head making little nods against his breast and heard
a muffled “Yes” from down there.

“It happened—what I told you I was trying to do. Those people took the
machine—bought it you know—and to-day they paid the money—and there’ll
be other payments coming in later. So now all the trouble is over—there
won’t be any more at all!”

She suddenly looked up in his face, but he gently drew her head down
again, so then she couldn’t see his face any more but lay there
resting, and hearing his voice saying how marvelous it was that this
sale had come just in time—for it _was_ in time. The doctors said it
would be all right and a certain cure if she could get away at once.
And now she could! They hadn’t definitely decided where she was to go,
but would in a day or two. It would be the most beneficial place in
the world for her—they’d make sure of that. And they’d send the best
nurse they could find to take care of her on the journey and when she
got there. And very soon—_very_ soon—she’d be entirely cured and strong
and well again.

When he stopped speaking she twisted around a little so that she could
see his face.

“What is it?” she whispered. Her heart was suddenly beating with a
vague alarm that she couldn’t understand.

He looked down and met her anxious gaze.

“But don’t you see, dear—it’s going to be so wonderful! We’ll have
enough for everything—more than enough. Plenty to take care of you and
plenty for me to go on with anything I want to do. I brought a little
over for you to get along on just for now—see, that package on the
chair there—where my hat is. Don’t mind what’s in it; remember there’s
a lot more—thousands. They paid all that down, you see, and I’m to have
so much a year to work for them—that is, after we’ve got _you_ all
right. That’s the first thing. I couldn’t do anything,—any work at all,
if I—if I was afraid about you. And you know what you have to do for
_your_ part, don’t you, dear one? Wherever the doctors say, you must
go, and whatever they tell you to do you’ll do, won’t you?”

Edith didn’t answer. She was lying quite motionless against him. He
looked down at her.

“But—but you——” she began in a faint voice, and stopped, hesitating.

“Yes?” he encouraged her tenderly.

“I mean you——” (Quite a pause.) “Aren’t you coming too—if I—if I have
to go a long way off?”

“Yes dear—as soon as I can! But to make this sale I had to agree to
oversee the setting up of the machine—and the regulating and all that.
It’s bound to take a little time—it’s bound to, dear—and it won’t do
for you to wait—oh no!”

“But—don’t you think you can come soon?”

“Oh——I do!”

“You see, I”—she clung against him—“I wouldn’t care much about getting
well if you weren’t there.”

“My dear!”

She seemed satisfied and nestled down. After a time she spoke again, a
little mournfully. “I hoped we could do what we always thought we would
as soon as you sold something. You know what we—what we planned.”

“Yes, I know.”

“Will there—will there be enough for that, too?”

“More than enough.”

“But I suppose this other”—with a little sighing breath—“I suppose it
must come first.”

“It must, my precious one.”

“Yes, I know.”

She had referred to their plan of having her get a divorce as soon as
there was money enough to do it.

After this they sat together, silent mostly.

Suddenly Haworth realized he ought to go. He knew some arrangement had
been made for detaining Findlay, but had kept no track of the time.
Now a strong feeling that the hour was late took possession of him.
For Edith’s peace of mind the fellow mustn’t find him there. But he
couldn’t leave without going upstairs to little Mildred, asleep in her
crib.

As they approached the door of the bedroom he stopped and caught Edith
to him, holding her close in his arms.

“My dear,” he whispered, and her lips, as she looked up in his face,
moved in a soundless “Yes.”

After a moment they went on; but in that moment her heart began
throbbing again with the same vague alarm she had felt before.

Haworth had stopped when just within the door of the room and stood
there for a little, looking across at the sleeping child; then he
suddenly turned away and hurried down the stairs into the room below.
Edith, following, felt her hands caught, with a sort of desperation, in
his, and heard his whispered, “Good night ... good night, my dear!”

He released her hands and was turning to leave her, when the front
door, opening and closing again with a violent bang, shook the flimsy
little house, and instantly thereafter Augustus Findlay plunged
into the room. He was out of breath from running, and frenzied with
precisely the right mixture of vindictive jealousy and vicious alcohol
to produce perfect ignition.

“I thought so!” he shouted between his gasps for wind. “By God! I just
got on to it they were trying to hold me back!” He glared across at
Haworth. “What the hell you doing here in the house with my wife?” He
was pulling something like a glove on his right hand as he spoke.

“I’m calling on Mrs. Findlay,” Haworth answered, quietly, and turned
toward Edith as if to say a final word.

“Calling, were you?” Augustus was striding toward him. “Well if you’re
_calling_ I’ve got to show my hand—an’ here it is you —— —— ——!” Saying
which he struck Haworth a savage blow in the face with the brass
knuckles he’d been putting on his hand.

Edith, uttering a subdued cry, tried to run in between the two, but
Haworth put out his hand and held her back. He was standing quite
unconcerned, though the blood was running down the left side of his
face from an ugly cut just under the eye.

Turning to Edith as though nothing out of the way had occurred, Haworth
raised her hand to his lips, looked deeply into her eyes, and huskily
murmuring “Good-bye,” walked out of the room and out of the house
without so much as a glance at Findlay.

For an instant the two left there stood silent; then Augustus
recovering himself made for the stairs, up which he rushed with
stumbling feet. When he came pounding down again a moment later
he found Edith blocking the way. “You shan’t go!” she called out,
breathlessly. “You shan’t go with that!”

“What?” he demanded, stopping before her.

“You’ve got it there under your coat!”

“What if I have?” (Trying to pass her.)

“You shan’t take it with you! No—no—no!” She was holding to his arm and
trying to reach the gun.

He shoved her violently aside and strode toward the door. “You think
I’m going to stop for _you_, you —— ——! No, by God! an’ you’ll damned
well get it yourself when I come back!” And he was gone before she had
time to recover herself.

       *       *       *       *       *

Augustus knew the streets Haworth would be likely to take to get home,
and started after him on a run—an unsteady one, owing to the load
of booze he was carrying, but he got over the ground. He had the gun
gripped in his hand and was muttering threats and foul names as he
plunged along.

But Haworth, realizing that his appearance would attract attention—for,
though he continually wiped his face, it went on bleeding—turned off
the most direct route through the well-lighted business district of
Egleston Square and Jamaica Plain, into some of the quiet streets
to the south. Even at that he had to pass through one of the lesser
business neighborhoods where there were shops with lighted windows and
people about on the sidewalks.

It was just along here that Findlay, not finding Haworth on the route
he’d expected him to take and turning off into side streets running
parallel thereto, came up with him. Shouting threats and menacing him
with his revolver, he strode along unsteadily by his side, attracting
the attention of everybody within hearing. Quite a few who happened to
be close at hand ran into shops or behind trees. Haworth’s bleeding
face added to the general alarm.

The young man suddenly turned on Findlay with a low-voiced warning.

“Keep away from me or you’ll get into trouble!” he said, and instantly
turned and walked as before.

“Trouble!” Augustus screamed. “You talk to me about trouble do you,
you —— —— ——! What in hell d’ye suppose _you’re_ going to get? I’ve
been waiting for this chance for a year, by God! for more’n a year,
by God! an’ now we’ll see where you get off, you —— —— ——!” And on he
went, letting out the foulest language he could lay his tongue to, with
Haworth paying no further attention to him; and the two disappeared
down a poorly lighted road which took them in the direction of Franklin
Park.

After this extraordinary and rather terrifying scene had shifted itself
well past the little area of shops and light, several of those who
had witnessed it came out from their places of refuge and a hurried
consultation was held, the result of which was a telephonic report of
the affair to police station 13 in Jamaica Plain, and assurance from
that quarter that a couple of men would be sent over.

One man who’d been a spectator, had sufficient curiosity to follow
Haworth and Augustus at a safe distance, and was joined later by
another who saw them pass a couple of blocks further on.

Haworth, dogged by the foul-mouthed nephew of old Michael Cripps,
turned in at the mansion gate and went up the dark and weed-grown drive
to the house. They mounted the steps of the front portico together, but
when Augustus made as if to follow him in, Haworth suddenly turned on
him. “You can’t come in here,” he said.

“We’ll see whether I can or not!” Findlay shouted, and began to fight
his way past.

“Very well, we will.” Saying which in his quiet way Haworth gripped
Augustus by the collar and gave him a shove that sent him back across
the portico nearly to the steps, and then turned and entered the house.
Findlay rushed back toward the door, which, as he reached it, was
slammed violently in his face and bolted inside. With an outburst of
the most malignant profanity he sprang against it like a maniac, making
frantic efforts to get it open, pounding and shouting and screaming
threats until exhausted and out of breath. After panting and fuming
there for a while the crazy idea took hold of him that he might get in
at a window—or at least get a look in, which was all he wanted. _One
look—that was all!_ And he stumbled and felt his way along the east
wall until he found himself under the large front window of the room on
the left. The shutters were closed, but at the bottom of one of them,
which was about on the level of his eyes as he stood on the ground,
there were two or three broken slats, and with the frenzied fit of rage
still shaking him like an ague he peered avidly in.

       *       *       *       *       *

Although Mrs. Temple had waited nearly two hours in the darkness
about halfway down the drive, hoping to intercept Mr. Haworth on his
return, she wasn’t there—as you’ve already gathered—when he finally
did come. She’d been sitting for a long time in the grass at the side
of the drive, her poor old heart beating the very life out of her with
anxiety, when she suddenly became aware that a peculiar mechanical
sound was coming from the direction of the mansion. She’d heard it
before while Mr. Haworth had been working in the basement. He must have
got home by some other way than the drive, and she’d missed him.

Limping back to the house, she got into the shrubbery near the side
windows and tried to see into the room on the left, but it was still
in darkness. She tried the other windows on that side with the same
result. The entrance hall seemed to be the only place in the house
where there was a light. The sounds in the house had now ceased. All
was quiet.

Then she heard a strident voice down the Torrington Road. Faint it was
at first, but gradually growing louder as the man doing the shouting
approached. Quarreling with some one he seemed to be. Oaths were
screamed out, and a great quantity of blackguardly language along with
them.

As the abusive and threatening clamor became more distinct Mrs. Temple
realized that the parties concerned were turning in at the gate and
coming up the drive.

Intensely alarmed, she moved through the shrubbery to the front corner
of the house, where she could get a view of the dimly lighted portico.

It was only a moment before Haworth, closely hounded by Augustus,
appeared out of the darkness of the drive, and the old woman caught
the metallic glint of something that Findlay had in his hand. Without
an instant’s hesitation she hobbled toward him; if she could have
got there she’d have torn the gun away from him or been shot in the
attempt. But before she’d gone halfway the two had mounted the steps,
and a second later Augustus was staggering back, with the door slammed
in his face.

Owing to Findlay’s outcries and his fierce beating against the door,
Mrs. Temple could at first hear nothing else, but when his hammering
and shouting subsided a little she began to notice again those strange
noises from within. Upon this she hurried back along the side of
the house, still avoiding the footpath and keeping in the bushes.
Determined now to get in, even though against Mr. Haworth’s wishes,
she made for the kitchen door, but couldn’t open it, and another rear
door giving into the back hall was also locked. Then she remembered
the basement entrance at the bottom of the stone steps. She found the
door there fastened, as she’d expected, but there was a secret way to
slide the bolt back by reaching in through an aperture in the side and
finding a cord to pull.

The cord was there, but she couldn’t make it work. It was tied in some
way, and after desperate attempts she had to give it up.

She was utterly terrified, for that drunken beast might get into the
house with his knife or pistol and do Mr. Haworth some fearful injury.
In addition to this danger something alarming was going on inside. She
could hear hurried footsteps and what seemed to her strange menacing
sounds.

She started back toward the front of the house, hobbling and stumbling
through the shrubbery, thinking she might find somebody down in
Torrington Road who’d come to her assistance.

But as she came toward the side windows of the room on the left, she
was amazed to see that, instead of the darkness that had prevailed, an
unusually brilliant light was shining out in narrow beams below the
roller shades. At both windows these shades had now been pulled down,
but as is quite commonly the case, they weren’t quite long enough to
reach the bottom of the windows. She hurried to the one nearest to the
front of the house and looked in through the narrow slit.

At once she saw Mr. Haworth seated by the large table, reading a book.
She watched him intently as he sat there occasionally turning the
pages. He seemed entirely at ease and untroubled. There was nothing
about him that gave the idea of anything being wrong or out of the way.
It amazed her that he could recover entire equanimity so soon after the
frightful time he’d been having with Augustus Findlay.

As she watched him he began to feel in his pockets in the absent-minded
way she knew so well, bringing out his pipe and tobacco pouch; then
he stopped reading and began to fill the pipe. It looked so safe and
commonplace after her frightful imaginings and premonitions, that she
hesitated about calling out to him, as she’d fully intended to do.

Now he rose and got a box of matches from the mantel, returning with
it to the table. She had a momentary impulse to speak to him through
the glass, but his singularly calm and reassuring behavior made her
hesitate. Could it be that she was mistaken after all?

Quite suddenly something peculiar startled her—a moving shadow on the
floor it seemed to be, and she realized that the whole room couldn’t
be seen from where she was: the back part, where the doors to the
breakfast room and the butler’s pantry were, was out of sight. This was
behind Haworth as he stood at the table lighting his pipe, and a wave
of horror swept over her as she started for the window farther back
which would give her a view of it.

The aperture below the shade at this window was very narrow, but she
twisted round, and looking sideways was able to see through into the
room.

At last! The frightful thing had come! Standing there behind Mr.
Haworth and aiming a terrible black thing straight at his head, a man,
his face hidden by a cloth or bandage, his clothes clinging to him as
though soaking wet.... She didn’t stop to see any more, but screamed
out a frantic warning, at the same time starting back for the other
window where she could see Haworth.

As she turned she saw dimly by the light sifting out under the shades,
that a man carrying a stepladder was hurrying down the walk toward the
front of the house, and she called to him as she ran, but didn’t stop
to see whether he heard or not. In an instant she was back at the
other window and looking in. Haworth was standing close to the table,
half leaning on it and holding a lighted match to his pipe, emitting
quick puffs of smoke as he drew on it. She shrieked out his name and
beat on the glass with her hands. But she’d no more than begun this
when two shots rang out—one close after the other and with reports so
deafening that they seemed to shake the house.

The old woman was unable to move, frozen, paralyzed, seeing Haworth
spin round as he was hit, and after a weak attempt to hold to the
table for support, sink to the floor. Almost at the same time her own
trembling legs gave way and she sank down, lying half on the ground
and half against the low-growing bushes beneath the window. But only
for the briefest moment was she there, for she’d hardly more than gone
down when she was struggling to her feet again. And as she did so she
saw by the light still shining through under the roller shade, that the
man who’d been running along the path must have stopped and dropped the
ladder, for he was picking it up; and as she stumbled blindly through
the bushes toward the rear of the house he started running toward the
front, dragging the ladder after him along the walk.

The doors of the kitchen and back hall were still locked, but she found
that some one had opened the basement entrance and she got in there.

Two policemen arriving shortly after—smashing a side window to get in,
as there wasn’t time to fumble with the doors—found the old woman on
the floor holding Haworth’s limp body in her arms, his head fallen back
against her breast.

The patrolmen who smashed their way into the house some twenty-six
minutes after the firing of the shots, were sent from Station 13.
The desk sergeant got the phone call from citizens in Jamaica Plain,
describing the terrifying progress through that district of the two
quarreling men with revolvers—blood streaming down the face of one of
them. He sent a man from the station, and also the patrolman on the
nearest beat as soon as his call came in. These two had no difficulty
in picking up the trail of consternation left along the route that
Haworth and Findlay had taken. But when they’d followed it a short
distance beyond Jamaica Plain the two citizens whose curiosity had led
them into trailing the quarreling men in order to see what happened,
came sprinting down the road in a frantic effort to get away, for
they’d been close to the mansion when the shooting took place and knew
that if someone was shot suspicion might light on them.

The patrolmen took these men for the ones they were after and grabbed
them. But in a minute they saw there was something else to it; and
after a bit of time wasted in sharp questioning they got at the truth
and made a run for the Cripps mansion, bringing the two citizens along
with them. Material witnesses at least, and a good chance they’d had a
hand in it—whatever it was. After smashing one of the kitchen windows
these two citizen chaps were shoved in first and stood back against
the wall with orders not to move. Then the officers, working with
their electric torches (for all the lights were now off) ran through
the butler’s pantry, guided by the pungent smell of gunpowder, and an
instant later found what they were looking for.

A quick glance at Haworth was all they needed. One took charge; the
other ran for the nearest patrol box and reported to his station. The
station notified headquarters, and down came a department automobile
with the chief inspector and three plain-clothes men and after that the
medical examiner (called coroner in most places) and two more uniformed
men. (They need a few uniforms in a case like this so people won’t
think it’s a hold-up.)

The medical examiner came in his own car, bringing his stenographer
and a surveyor with him, as was his custom. I don’t think it’s the
usual thing to run a surveyor in, outside of Boston. Of course there
were photographers and all that, and it wasn’t any time at all before
newspapermen were swarming about.

Mrs. Temple hardly noticed anything—excepting that the lights went
suddenly on—until she found herself being urged back by one of the
policemen—he was gentle enough with the old woman—toward the swing
door of the butler’s pantry. James Dreek was standing just within the
door, looking pale and frightened, with a sort of wild-eyed blankness
on his face. The officer told them they’d have to go back into the
kitchen, and Dreek disappeared in that direction, but Mrs. Temple tried
to resist, looking back to where men were bending over Haworth—the
surveyor making measurements of positions and distances, working by
compass; the medical examiner cutting away parts of his clothing. She
made an effort to push past the policeman and get back to the body, but
he prevented her, speaking with rough kindness: “Now, now, ma’am, you
won’t be allowed over there!” But as he looked at the old woman he saw
it wasn’t an ordinary case.

“One o’ the family, ma’am?” he asked in a low voice.

“Yes. Let me by!”

“You can’t do anything, lady—he’s past help.”

“I can be there with ’im, can’t I?”

“Not now, ma’am—but if you’re one o’ the family they’ll let you in
afterwards.”

She said no more, but went where he directed. There were a number of
persons waiting in the kitchen—all exits from which were guarded—but
she didn’t notice them, nor had she any idea of what was going on—that
the detectives were searching every part of the house and going
over the grounds outside with electric torches; that a couple of
plain-clothes men were out after the man who’d followed Haworth through
the streets, threatening him with a revolver; that the people waiting
there in the room with her were being taken into another room one by
one, to be questioned.

       *       *       *       *       *

Some time later she found herself in the great entrance hall, standing
before a man at an improvised desk of rough boarding. There were police
about and a plain-clothes man was writing things on sheets of paper.
Two or three others not in uniform were standing near, apparently
uninterested, but in reality watching her like cats. The old woman
glanced at the various people in the room, hardly aware that they were
real. It might just as well have been a dream. After a time she thought
she heard some one speaking to her.

“What?” she asked, looking about vaguely.

An officer came to her and explained that she must answer the questions.

“What questions?” she inquired.

It appeared there was curiosity as to her name, age, and occupation.
She gave the information in a low mumbling voice, speaking absently.

That out of the way, the inspector, noticing that she was inattentive,
began with sharp emphasis:

“Mrs. Temple, you knew the deceased, did you not?”

The old woman turned to him, startled, and stood looking at him a
moment. Then she looked away, glancing rather vaguely about the room.
She was beginning to realize where she was and what was going on.

“Well, are we going to hear anything from you this evening?”

“Are you the perlice?” she asked with a sharpness of her own.

“You’re here to answer questions—not to ask them.”

“I’d like to know if you’re the perlice, that’s all!”

“This is a police investigation, if that’s what you mean. We’re taking
testimony throwing light on the crime just committed here. You may be
able to help us.”

“No——” Mrs. Temple shook her old gray head. “I won’t be able to help ye
none.”

“You mean you don’t know anything about it?”

“I mean what I told ye—that I won’t be able to help ye none.”

“You don’t seem to realize your position, madam. We can compel you
to answer questions here. But you ought to be willing to give us any
information you can without that, so we can find the guilty man and
bring him to the punishment he deserves.”

“What good’ll punishment do, I’d like to know? What’s the good o’ that
to—to the poor dear man lyin’ there—shot down like a dog he was—doin’
no harm to no one—juss standin’ there lightin’ his pipe—and shot down
like a dog!” She was unable to go on for a moment; but having caught
what she said about Haworth lighting his pipe, the inspector waited
for her. He would give her plenty of time and nurse her along, for it
looked very much as though she’d been a witness to the actual shooting.

“A nice lot of folks _you_ be,” the old woman finally went on in a
broken voice but with deep indignation back of it. “What was ye doin’
before, I’d like to know, asettin’ around offices an’ paradin’ up
and down the streets! When I went an’ warned ye more’n a week ago
that we was in danger over here, I was told there warn’t nothin’ you
could do—not till somebody done somethin’. Well, now some one’s done
somethin’ an’ ye come hurryin’ around askin’ us all about it! But ye
needn’t take no trouble askin’ me. I’ve told ye all I’ve got to tell. I
told it to one of yer perlice a-strollin’ up an’ down Centre Street in
a nice uniform with brass buttons on it!”

The inspector made no attempt to interrupt or cut short Mrs. Temple’s
somewhat fervent remarks, and when she’d quite finished he spoke to her
in a carefully softened tone.

“You’re certainly right, Mrs. Temple,” he said, “as to its being too
late to do anything now for the—the unfortunate victim in this case.
His murder was, as you indicate, a most cold-blooded crime. Every
additional particular that is brought out adds to its cruelty and
brutality. And was it really a fact, as I think you intimated, that the
poor fellow was lighting his pipe as the shots were fired?” He looked
sympathetically and inquiringly at the old woman.

But Mrs. Temple’s mouth was shut and there were no signs visible that
she had any intention of opening it.

“Rot in jail before she’d talk if she didn’t want to,” was the
inspector’s unspoken comment. Well, they’d have to make her want to,
that was all. So she was excused, almost with apologies, and allowed to
go where she pleased. But wherever that was a detective would be on the
job and not lose track of her for an instant.

All available information was in, but the plain-clothes men were still
working through the house and grounds. No weapon of any kind had yet
been found, and no bullet marks discovered in the room. The theory
regarding the latter was that the bullets (it was taken for granted
they’d been fired through the front window) struck against the masonry
of the fireplace or chimney and left no noticeable mark. In that case,
however, they should have been found where they dropped—and the search
for them was still going on.

Notwithstanding there were any number of witnesses to the following
of Haworth home by an infuriated man using the most abusive language
and threatening him with a revolver, no one could be found who had
any idea who this person was. Nor had anyone seen him make an attack
on Haworth that would result in the cut and bruise which had been
found on his face. The two Jamaica Plains citizens who’d followed the
quarreling couple to the house gave as good a description of him as
could be expected. But their statement that the instant before the
shots were fired he was peering in through the large window at the left
of the entrance portico and had his revolver gripped in his hand, was
positive and unshaken. Also that he stayed there a few seconds after
the firing,—though they could not make out what he was doing,—and then
turned suddenly and dashed madly down the drive into Torrington Road.
Everything pointed to this person as the man they wanted, and the
inspector had detectives out after him when the taking of testimony
had hardly begun.

The report of the medical inspector with the “survey” attached, showing
all distances, positions, heights, measurements of everything in the
room, as well as all particulars relating to the body of the murdered
man, had been turned in. Out of this technical mass of information a
few facts adapted to the limited intelligence of the layman could be
extracted. Charles Haworth’s tragic death resulted from whichever of
the two gunshot wounds found upon him was inflicted first. Either would
have caused it instantly. The shots were discharged from a distance
of from fifteen to twenty feet. No chance therefore existed of the
wounds being self-inflicted. The distance of the weapon or weapons at
the instant of discharge, the locality of the wounds and the course of
the projectiles through the body, made such a feat impossible. Both
missiles had come from behind the victim, one entering at the back of
the head and drilling the brain, the other striking near the middle of
the spine and passing through the heart. There were no burns or powder
marks on the clothing nor on the head or body, where the projectiles
went in.

The upward course of the bullets demonstrated two things—and you can
see from both of them how nicely the services of a surveyor came in:
first, Haworth must have been standing when he was shot, for otherwise
the assailant couldn’t have got low enough down to fire at the angle
shown; second, even with Haworth standing, the weapon must have been
held well down to give the bullets their upward course; but as accurate
aim (which had evidently been taken) would have been difficult if not
impossible while holding the gun down within two or three inches of
the floor, the probability was that the assailant had been standing
outside of one of the windows and had fired into the room from near the
bottom of it.

The detectives had a fresh filled pipe—the tobacco on top hardly more
than singed; a book fallen open on its face, crumpling the leaves; a
box of matches; one partly burned match—all from the floor close to the
body. The exact position of each article was given in the survey.

Haworth had evidently been reading and had stopped to fill and light
his pipe as the first of the two bullets made an end of him. No
evidence of a struggle with anyone—none that he had an idea of what was
about to happen.

Two persons concerned in this tragic affair got away from the mansion
and its vicinity before the arrival of the police—Hugo Pentecost from
within, slipping out quietly through the basement entrance, proceeding
through the rear of the property and coming into town by way of
Brookline,—thus avoiding Torrington Road and Roxbury altogether; and
Augustus Findlay from the front, rushing blindly down the drive like a
wild man pursued by seven devils.

After one fearful moment when he’d stood, stunned and paralyzed,
looking through the broken slats near the bottom of the shutters of
the front window—the booze suddenly swept from his system—the crashing
reports of the shots ringing in his ears and Haworth lying there in a
crumpled heap on the floor, Findlay was suddenly recalled to himself
by feeling the weight of something dragging down his right arm; and
raising it into a bar of light coming through the chinks in the
shutter, he saw his revolver gripped in his hand, his forefinger still
hooked to the trigger. He knew—hazily, but he knew it—that he’d been
following Haworth and threatening him with the gun.... And so at last
he’d done it! In a drunken frenzy he’d killed a man! Murder—murder—that
was it! The crime they hang people for or sizzle the life out of them,
strapped in an electric chair! They’d have _him_ for that if he stayed
there. Flight was his only chance, yet he couldn’t move. He saw the
lights suddenly go off in the house—somebody already there! A moment
later he heard a loud voice within calling out something, yet still his
feet were weighted with lead. Then came the sound of quick footsteps
from around the southeast corner. Some one was coming down the path at
the side of the house and dragging some heavy wooden thing—he heard it
grating along the stone flagging. Wheeling about with a desperate jerk,
he fled madly down the drive.

Findlay had been running only a few minutes (he was out on the
Torrington Road by this time) when he suddenly thought of his gun. It
mustn’t be found on him! Looking frantically about, he saw a thick
clump of shrubbery on one of the front lawns and quite near the road.
No one would look for it there! But as he stopped to pitch the weapon
over the fence he discovered that he was being followed! He mustn’t be
seen throwing the thing away—that alone would convict him! There was
nothing to do but run with the gun in his hand. Perhaps he could see a
hole or drain where he could drop it without a noticeable motion as he
ran.

Somewhere about the time the homicide squad arrived at the Cripps
mansion an individual whose clothing set him down as a laboring man and
who was evidently carrying a load of something with more than one-half
of one percent alcoholic content, walked a trifle unsteadily into the
South Station by the Atlantic Avenue entrance, looked blankly about,
and then stopped a man who was hurrying past and asked where there was
a telephone. On having the booths pointed out to him, he mumbled a
thick “much obliged” and made his way to them, getting into No. 19 and
occupying it for some little time. Then he reappeared in the concourse,
and after further inquiries of various persons, found the gate for the
11:35 P.M. train for New York (“Advanced” time). With much fumbling in
his pockets and boozy mutterings as a running accompaniment thereto, he
produced a ticket, and after passing in at the gate tried to give it
up to the Pullman and train conductors seated at a table just inside;
they, however, refusing to take it—as only Pullman passengers gave
their tickets there—he went on toward the train, and eventually climbed
aboard one of the day coaches.

Walking bravely down the aisle, finding not a little assistance from
the friendly arms and backs of the seats on each side, he half fell
into an unoccupied seat—the next to the last at the extreme forward
end. It might have been observed (but it wasn’t) that this seat gave a
person the advantage of having all the lights of the car at his back,
leaving his face in comparative obscurity.

Not long after the train passed the Back Bay station this man was half
asleep, his head bobbing about; and the conductor took his ticket
from the band of his cap where he had stuck it, and passed on without
getting a view of his face.

On arrival at the Grand Central a few minutes before six in the morning
(a few minutes before five, standard) he was left snoozing in his
seat after the rest of the passengers had filed out. A moment or two
later the head end trainman, running through the coaches to see that
all was clear, stopped and shook him, not altogether gently, into
consciousness, yelling as he did so, “All out—all out—Grand Central!...
You get out here!”

The drowsy chap, coming to himself and doubtless being considerably
hazy, conceived that he was being attacked, and hit out in all
directions. The result was a scuffle of wrestling and pulling, all the
more eagerly entered into by the trainman because of having had a lot
of trouble during the night trying to keep the fellow’s muddy boots off
the seat in front of him, throwing them off by main force a number of
times. The present struggle ended in the enraged passenger falling in
the aisle and being dragged out by his feet to the station platform.

       *       *       *       *       *

On this same morning the steamer _North Land_, from the stern of which
Mr. Pentecost had rather skillfully disembarked a few hours after she
left Boston, came down the Sound and through Hell Gate, emerging into
the East River at about eight o’clock, daylight-saving time. Half an
hour later she was rounding the Battery into the North River, and not
long after that was backing into her berth alongside Pier 18.

By this time most of the passengers were massed in the saloon lobby of
the hurricane deck, their small luggage in their hands, ready to go
ashore through the starboard door of that lobby as soon as the steamer
was made fast and the gangplank run out from the wharf. Nearly every
officer and steward and deckhand was on duty on the starboard side,
which was the landing side in this instance, as the steamer slowly
backed in alongside her wharf.

A small rowboat had been lying close up under the stringpieces at the
shore end of the pier. There were three men in it, apparently of the
deckhand order, and they had mops and pails in the bottom of the boat
and across the seats. They had rowed in there some time before the
arrival of the steamer, coming along the south side of the slip among
the barges and scows of the New York Central Railroad Company which, at
this time, occupied the pier on that side as a freight terminal.

As the _North Land_ came slowly gliding in stern first, the men in
the rowboat pulled out into the middle of the slip and waited there.
A moment after she was made fast and the crew on the fantail had gone
forward, a man in the uniform of a ship’s officer stepped out of the
passageway near the stern on the port side (the passengers were to
disembark on the starboard) and motioned to the men in the rowboat,
upon which they pulled up close under the guard and began to make an
examination of the hull near the water line. Soon after this they had
mops out and appeared to be swabbing off something on the ship’s side,
the officer overlooking the job from the rail above them. A moment
later there were two others watching them, not in the ship’s uniform,
one from some distance forward on the port outside passageway, and the
other from near the stern end of it where it opens into the fantail.
These men each had a movie camera focused on the party in the rowboat,
and when one of the swabbers was trying to get at a place that was too
high to reach and the officer dropped him a rope ladder, the two men
kept their cameras trained on him as he clambered up and stepped over
the rail into the passage, and still followed him as he was reaching
down the ship’s side with his mop in one hand while clinging to the
rail with the other.

This man—the deckhand or swabber who had come aboard by the rope
ladder—got somehow mixed with one or two others of his kind who came
out into the passage, but eventually he could be seen climbing down
the ladder again and into the boat; and very soon after that the three
rowed lazily away with their buckets and mops. The officer hauled the
rope ladder aboard and disappeared through the “emergency exit” into
the ship’s cabin, and the men with the cameras were already gone,
one walking forward along the port passageway, and the one who had
been near the stern passing round to the starboard side by way of the
fantail. Everything was smoothly and rapidly done, the whole thing
occupying scarcely four minutes from the time the rowboat came up to
the ship’s side.

It’s hardly necessary to tell you that after this little performance
was over, the man who climbed the rope ladder with his mop was still on
board the steamer, and that the man with the same mop who went down the
ladder into the rowboat was another person altogether. Nor is it of the
least importance to mention names, for you gentlemen can hardly fail to
be aware that it was Mr. Pentecost who thus came aboard and that it was
one of his “trusties”—made up and dressed to appear in every way like
him—who slid down into the rowboat; so that it might be seen, if anyone
kept account of such things, that the number of men in it when it was
rowed away from the steamer was not less than when it came up under
the stern. And, as you can readily imagine—if you have not already
done so—the entire scene was played, as one might say, for outside
consumption only—that is, for whoever might be about in boats or barges
or on the railway pier opposite. No one connected with the steamer
could have any knowledge of it; a passenger approaching from either
direction on one of the passages would have been begged, by whichever
camera man blocked the way, to wait just a moment until the picture
was taken; an officer or seaman would receive quite the same request,
but with the added explanation that their film concern had obtained
permission from the Eastern Steamship Lines, Inc., to photograph a
bunch of seamen (which is to say, actors posing as such) swabbing blood
off the steamer’s side.

No one would have recognized Pentecost in the confusion, even had he
been seen; and it was perfectly true that such permission had been
asked and granted. Indeed, the company had loaned an officer’s uniform
to help it along. There seemed to have been a little misunderstanding
as to dates, but that was a small matter. Back of it all, if it ever
got to it, they’d have found a company and a scenario, and a couple of
thousand feet of film already taken.

       *       *       *       *       *

The passengers, herded in the saloon lobby of the hurricane deck, which
was the one they were to disembark from, were growing impatient. Those
nearest the open door on the starboard side had noticed a couple of
men on the dock in conversation with a policeman, and the moment the
gangplank was run out the latter had given a signal of some kind and
the ship’s officers held everybody back. The two men came aboard at
once and went with the Purser into his office, where they scanned the
passenger list. A little later the Captain came to the door and the
Purser asked him to step in a moment. Shortly after that the Steward
and head waiter were sent for. Then (the whole affair had hardly
taken five minutes) the two men went ashore with the Purser, and at
once the ship’s officers who were blocking the way stood aside, the
two ticket takers from the New York office took their places, and the
passengers began to leave the steamer.

Near the foot of the gangplank in the vast dock building was a corner
partition where the passengers coming ashore made a turn to the right.
Back in this corner, which commanded a view of the people filing past
the two ticket takers and down the gangplank, stood the Purser with the
two men who had been looking over the passenger list in his office.

It was toward the end of the stream of disembarking passengers that Mr.
Pentecost and the two Harkers, father and son, came into view at the
top of the gangway, with one of the stewards carrying their luggage. As
they came ashore and were approaching the right-hand turn, the Purser
stepped out and shook hands with them, trusting they’d had a restful
night after their strenuous day in Boston, and wishing them good luck
with their new invention. All was in the most jovial manner, and the
three passed on toward the street. But before they’d got there one of
the stewards came running after them and said that if they had time
the Purser would like to see them for just a minute. “Why, certainly,”
Pentecost said. “Tell him we’ll be right along!”

Harker was alarmed and started to say something under his breath, but
Pentecost growled in a half whisper, without looking at him, “Can’t you
see everything they do stamps it!”

Alfred went on toward the street to get a taxi, and the two partners
turned back.

The Purser was still on the dock near the gangplank, but the two men
who’d been with him were gone—at least, not in sight. But don’t imagine
that fooled Pentecost any.

“Didn’t mean to trouble you,” Mr. Lawson called out as the two came
near.

“No trouble,” said Pentecost.

“Not at all,” added Harker. “What’s going?”

“Why, I’ve just heard something that might concern you gentlemen in a
business way. Man came aboard a minute ago and was telling about a hell
of a murder last night over in Boston.”

“Murder, eh?” said Harker, with the interest such news might naturally
inspire—but no more.

“What makes you think we’d be concerned?” Pentecost inquired.

“Hardly a chance you are—only he said it was out in West Roxbury, and I
remembered you told us _your_ man——”

“What was the name—did he say?” Pentecost asked quickly and with
awakening anxiety—just the right amount you know—not the merest trifle
overdone.

“Why no, I don’t think he did.”

Pentecost glanced at Harker and Harker at him.

“A lot of things might happen in West Roxbury,” he said, turning back
to the Purser.

“Sure they might,” assented that official; “but he said it was an
inventor chap living out there alone.”

“Inventor!” exclaimed Pentecost. “Living out——By George! And all that
money we——” He broke off, and suddenly turning to go was heard to say,
“I’ve got to make a run for a train!”

Harker emitted a “My God!” and followed his partner up the dock. But
Pentecost stopped suddenly a few yards away, where he could still be
seen and heard by the Purser (or anyone concealed in the vicinity),
and pulling out a N. Y., N. H. & H. Railroad folder, began looking for
express trains to Boston.

“That’s right,” Harker said, coming up to him. “We’ll get the first
train out!”

The Purser was approaching them.

“You stay here,” said Pentecost. “There’s a lot of business at the
office. I can wire if I want you. Here”—looking at the folder—“‘New
York to Boston’—I ought to get the nine o’clock.”

“No—” (from Harker) “half-past nine now!”

“That’s Daylight—railroad’s on Standard.”

“So it is—train’s ten our time—just make it!”

Pentecost seized the Purser’s hand. “Thank you very much, Mr. Lawson.
You’ve done us a great favor.” And as he was turning to go: “We paid
that man something like thirty thousand yesterday. A yegg’s run up on
him—that’s what it is!” He hurried out to the street and jumped into
the taxi that Alfred was holding, pushed a five-dollar bill into the
driver’s hand with “Grand Central—make time!” and shouting out a few
parting directions to Harker as the taxi started with a great jerk (the
driver was earning his money) he was whirled away into the traffic.

       *       *       *       *       *

The man who was following Augustus Findlay as he fled wildly away from
the Cripps mansion a few seconds after the sound of the two revolver
shots split the air, wasn’t by any means putting a shadow on him, but
was running him close, never less than thirty yards behind, and a flash
on him from his pocket torch whenever it was safe to throw a light.
His name was Graham and he knew his business. He kept so near that
Findlay didn’t get a chance to pitch his gun anywhere, and what’s more,
I doubt if he could have done it if he’d got the chance, for the minute
he realized he was being followed and the light flashed on him every
few seconds, he was virtually on the scrap heap—which is to say, out of
his head with terror.

It was in a quiet block of Collamore Street over near the railroad
tracks that Graham ran up on him and bumped him against the iron post
or column of a street light. This nearly knocked Findlay over, but
Graham got him by the throat and shut off his wind before he had a
chance to fall, and in his wild struggles to loosen Graham’s grip so he
could get air, and Graham doing some extra thrashing about trying to
hold him, it gave the idea there was the liveliest kind of a fight on;
and a man in his shirt sleeves, who’d been sitting smoking a pipe at a
second-story window nearly above, commenced to yell at them to quit.

From that minute you could see that Graham was trying to get Findlay’s
revolver away from him, twisting his arm, trying to bite his fingers
loose, and all the while shouting out, “You damn dirty sneak, gimme
that gun! Gimme the gun, I say! It’s the gun I want!” and things like
that. And Augustus, who was terrified, thinking they were after the
thing to prove murder on him, clung to it with the tenacity of an
octopus.

The man at the second-story window, whose name it later appeared
was Rathbun, finding yelling to the two scrappers was no good, came
downstairs and out at the street door of the tenement building; but
seeing—or, to be more accurate, hearing what it was they were fighting
for, hesitated in the doorway, as he had an aversion to being shot up.
In this instant of Rathbun’s hesitation Graham gave Augustus a smash in
the face that made him loosen his hold, and then snatching the revolver
out of his hands turned and raced up Collamore Street, carrying it by
the muzzle; and Rathbun noticed, as the man swung into a street light,
that the hand he was holding it with had a glove on it.

After Graham got safely away, Rathbun went out to Findlay, who was
lying in the road, and tried to find out what it was all about and
whether he was hurt. But he couldn’t get anything out of the fellow.

After a few moments Findlay got to his feet unsteadily, stared blankly
at Rathbun for a second or two, then wheeled around and went limping
down the street toward the railroad. A sorry-looking object he was,
battered and torn and plastered with mud. But his mental condition was
sorrier. Maudlin and devastating fright possessed him. He’d done a
murder—murder—murder! Shot a man, killed a man, and they were hunting
for him—they’d get him! Drunkenness no defense. He’d looked that up
before, when he really thought of doing it! This time he didn’t think.
And he’d done it!

He stopped. If he went home they’d get him there. But if he tried to
get away it would be the same as a confession of guilt. If he went home
he could deny everything—insist that he didn’t know what they were
talking about—that he hadn’t left the house all that evening. Edith
must back him up. That is, if anyone came for him. But after all, why
should they? No one could possibly have seen him at the Haworth place.
It was dark as pitch. And the shutters were closed, so no light shone
on him. Yet who could the man have been who got his revolver? Just
a plain hold-up, that’s what it was. Yet he thought he’d heard him
following from way back near Torrington Road. But if he was a detective
he’d have arrested him. And, anyway, a detective couldn’t have got on
the job thirty seconds after Haworth was k——. Great God! He couldn’t
say it even to himself.

With his mind seething, he stumbled up the two steps to his front door
and stopped there with his hand on the knob and a quick glance up the
street, thinking he heard some one following. He turned with a sudden
terror and tried to open the door, but it was locked. He shook it and
pounded on it, and the instant he heard Edith turn the key in the lock
he burst in, closed the door frantically after him, and stood pushing
against it as if trying to keep some one out.

Edith stood quiet, watching his feverish terror. When he finally ceased
his violent pushing against the door she spoke.

“Tell me,” she said.

“Tell you what? Whad’ ye mean? I ain’t got anything to tell!”

“You have.”

“I have not! I been in a fight, that’s all. A hell of a dirty footpad
jumped on me—just over the other side of the railroad—but he didn’t get
any money—he only took my gun!”

“Your revolver?”

“Can’t you hear what I say?”

“What had you been doing with it?”

“What had——I just had it along. How could I be doing anything when
he took it away from me!” The man was almost sobbing. “You ain’t got
any right to talk to me like that! You’d ought to help me—that’s what
you’d ought to do! I’m going to bed and you tell ’em I was here all
this evening! You can do that much for me, I should think. I was here
reading a book, that book over there on the stand—that’s all you got
to say. What’s the harm o’that? Just tell ’em I was here reading that
book?”

Edith shook her head.

Then followed begging and crying and protesting on his part, but with
no response on hers. She didn’t speak again.

After Augustus had gone whining upstairs and locked himself in his
bedroom, Edith opened the front door and looked out into the dismal
night. She was hesitating. If it hadn’t been for leaving little Mildred
alone in the house with the crazed brute (who had often threatened
to kill the child) she’d have hurried through the dark streets to
Torrington Road. She knew from her husband’s behavior that something
fearful had happened, yet without an idea of how terrible it was.

Finally she sat on a chair in the small living room and waited. There
was nothing else to do.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was early morning when they came—still dark. Edith heard their feet
on the wooden steps and then the heavy knock on the front door.

Two men stood there, dressed in ordinary clothes. And she could see a
uniformed policeman moving back at the side of the house. It was the
patrolman on the beat who’d been phoned from headquarters to keep an
eye on the place till the Inspectors got there. Now they’d come and
were sending him to cover the rear.

The men at the door were roughly polite. They were sorry to disturb
her, but was Mr. Findlay at home?

“Yes.”

“We’d like to see him.”

“He’s in his room upstairs. I’ll tell him you’re here.”

But as she turned to go the man who’d been speaking called after her:

“If it’s all the same to you we’ll go——Which room is it?”

“The back one—farthest from the stairs.”

“Thank you ma’am.”

The men ran up, and she heard their loud knocking on the door and gruff
orders to Findlay to open it.

Then came the crash of splintering wood (the door was a flimsy affair)
and their heavy tread as they rushed into the room. A moment later
there were more distant voices, and the men came hurrying down again.

“They got him outside, ma’am,” one of them said. “Sorry to make you all
this trouble.” And the two passed out at the front door. Edith called:

“Oh, wait! I want to——”

One of the men turned in the doorway.

“I want you to—I want you to tell me if—if——Oh, what is it?”

“Some trouble in West Roxbury, ma’am. You can find out from
headquarters.”

As the man passed into the street she could hear Augustus’s voice
through the open door. He was whining and crying that he didn’t know
anything about it—he was here at home all the evening reading a
book—that was what he was doing—he never once left the house—ask his
wife if they didn’t believe it—she was right there—just ask her; in the
midst of which came a rough caution from one of the inspectors that
he’d better keep his mouth shut—he could tell all that to the chief.
A moment later came the clatter of a car driven up from somewhere,
the slamming of its door, and the sound of its rapid departure up the
street.

A number of things were happening along here that I’m not going to try
to describe to you. My supposition is that I’m able to get away with
plain facts so they’ll be understood, which is all I aim at. But when
it comes to telling you about Edith Findlay through all this affair—her
going over to the mansion as soon as she could get a neighbor to take
care of little Mildred, and staying there with all that was left of
poor Haworth as long as they’d let her; and later her being at the
funeral; and after that sitting stunned and dry-eyed in her little
parlor at home while she slowly came to the realization of what it
meant—that the one person who was all there was in the world for her
had gone forever, and that somehow it was through her that the terrible
thing had come about—I’m out of it altogether. I can only briefly refer
to it as I’ve just been doing.

Yet with all these fearful things coming down on her, the poor
child—frail and delicate and already in the grip of the demon of
disease—had it in her to stand up to it, quiet and brave. I made a
mistake, though, when I said all these fearful things coming down on
her, for she knew only one. Others had no place in her mind. They
didn’t even occur to her.

And with old Mrs. Temple it was much the same, though in a different
way. Back of all the police investigations, and questionings of
witnesses, and photographing, and ransacking the mansion and grounds
surrounding it, and the sensational newspaper write-ups, and arrests,
and talk, and confusion, was this cruel blow for each of them—the loss
of the one who was dear to them.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mr. Pentecost left the train at Back Bay Station on arrival in Boston,
thus saving about five minutes. And he saved some three minutes more
by not having to explain to the taxi man where Torrington Road could
be found, the morning and early afternoon papers having thoroughly
attended to that.

It was a few minutes after four o’clock (Advanced time) when his
machine came tearing up the drive—that is, tearing up the lower
part of it, for it was stopped by a patrolman some distance from
the house. Two policemen and a plainclothesman were on watch there.
Pentecost hurriedly explained who he was, and that his firm had paid
a large amount of money the day before for one of the murdered man’s
inventions—which was still in the house, he supposed. They’d left it
crated in the front hall.

The detective made no reply to that, but instead informed Mr. Pentecost
that the Chief would like to see him at headquarters.

“Yes, but wait a minute!” remonstrated Pentecost. “I want to find out
if that machine——”

“You can talk it over with the Inspector when you get there.”

“Talk it over! But my God, man—it’s our property!”

“The Inspector’ll attend to that. You don’t need to worry.”

“Was there a truck out here after it?”

“There sure was, but the truck didn’t get it. How do we know but it
might have something to do with the case?”

“Have you got the idea that anybody’s going to shoot up a man for a
three-ton machine he couldn’t get out of the house?”

“Ask the Inspector that.”

Pentecost was allowed to go in and satisfy himself that his property
was still in the house and had not been tampered with. After a moment
of breathing easier (not overdone you know) upon finding that this was
the case, he apparently began to call to mind that a terrible crime had
been committed and finally asked if he could see the poor chap who’d
been shot. But the body’d been taken to the morgue some hours before.

Half an hour later the detective and Mr. Pentecost arrived at Pemberton
Square and the Inspector didn’t keep them waiting long. Besides the
latter there were two plain-clothes men in the room—one at a table
ready to make notes, the other standing back near the window. The
Inspector, seated at his desk, greeted Pentecost pleasantly; and after
an informal question or two regarding his business and the methods of
running it, came down to the matter in hand.

“Understand your firm’s been having some dealings with the man they
shot out in Roxbury—or rather Jamaica Plain—last night.”

“Why yes, we just bought an invention of his—that is, rights to exploit
and so forth—and paid the money down for it. It was only yesterday, and
the machine’s still out there in the house. One of your men in charge
advised me to speak to you about it, and I certainly hope you’ll be so
good as to arrange it so we can——”

“All in good time Mr. Pentecost. First I’d like to have you tell me
what you know about the affair or the people concerned in it.”

“Yes, certainly, certainly—er——” Pentecost appeared to be slightly
flurried by having the subject shifted so suddenly away from what was
apparently uppermost in his mind. (It might be just as well to remember
I said “appeared to be” and “apparently.”)

“Your firm specializes in novelties of a mechanical nature, you
say—organizes companies and that sort of thing?”

“Yes—yes, we—that’s our business.”

“What are some of the inventions you’ve handled?”

“Well, there’s quite a number. The latest thing we took over was the
Crudex Oil Burning Device. We’re also behind the Polaris Refrigerating
Machine, the Acme Vacuum Cleaner and other successful things. Of course
we hit on a loser now and then, but our average stands up well.”
(Pentecost had naturally given out the straight deals that the firm had
undertaken—sometimes at considerable expense—for precisely this sort of
emergency.)

“That being your business, I take it you were attracted to Haworth’s
inventions.”

“Yes—I was.—That is, to one of them.”

“How did you happen to hear of them?”

“From reading a Sunday supplement write-up when I was over here a
couple of weeks ago—or thereabout.” And Pentecost went on to give
an account of how he went out there to see what sort of mechanical
novelties the inventor had, and to describe his visit to the ancient
mansion—the young man alone there with an old charwoman—the finding of
a device that greatly interested him—the bringing of his partner over
from New York to see it—and their ultimate purchase of the rights in
the machine and the payment of quite a large sum of money down.

“Did you see much of the old woman you speak of,—the one who came in to
cook for him and so on?”

“Not a great deal, but I had to admire her.”

“Why? What did you admire?”

“The game way she kept at it trying to protect Mr. Haworth from us,—for
she got the idea we were trying to rob him or something like that. She
bothered us some listening around, but it was no great matter, so I let
it go.—Though now I think of it I did drive her away once.”

“What was the reason for that?”

“The machine we were negotiating for depended on a secret process,
as you might say. That is, he managed his combustion to compress air
direct without the use of intervening machinery. Something they’d
hardly allow a patent on. That’s why I’m so nervous about it. I hope
nobody takes it out of that crate.”

“Was the old woman trying to see it?”

“Trying to see anything she could. We’d find her everywhere. I don’t
suppose she’d have understood the thing even if she’d got a good look
at it, but I always like to play safe when there’s no patent. So we
finally asked Haworth to keep her out of the house till we got the
machine away.”

After questioning Pentecost on other points, the business transaction
between Haworth and the firm was taken up,—the fourteen-day option, the
payment of the thirty-five thousand dollars, the arrangement made with
him for coming on to New York and setting up and adjusting the machine,
and his agreement to work under their direction for five years.

“It was a cash transaction I understand—this payment of thirty-five
thousand?”

“Yes—he insisted on having it that way.”

“Do you know his reasons for that?”

“No.”

“You actually paid him that amount—in bills?”

“Yes. That is to say, he received it from the firm. Alfred Harker, our
secretary, was the one who handed it to him.”

“But you saw—yourself—that that amount was paid over to him?”

“Yes, I did. I watched Harker counting it out for him.”

“Into his hands?”

“Well, no, it was rather too bulky for that. He counted it out on the
table.”

“And Haworth took it?”

“Yes.”

“What did he do with it—put it in his pocket?”

“I’m not sure, but I should say not. It was rather too large for an
ordinary pocket.”

“Mr. Pentecost, where, exactly, was that bunch of bills when you last
saw it?”

“My recollection isn’t clear enough to admit of a positive statement. I
have the impression that Haworth held it in his hands a short time and
then put it down on the table and stood there with one hand resting on
it.”

“What happened then?”

“Soon after the money was paid we left the house.”

“Did he bring it to the door with him when he went to see you out?”

“He didn’t come to the door—we left him standing at the table.”

“He said good night to you there?”

“Yes. And it was then that he was standing—as I remember it—with one
hand resting on the stack of bills.”

“You referred to an agreement you made with him for working under your
direction. Was he entirely willing to agree to this or did you have to
urge it to some extent?”

“We had some discussion, but he finally saw it was to his advantage,
and signed the contract willingly.”

“Have you that contract with you?”

“My partner took charge of it. I can wire him and he’ll get it in the
mail to-night.”

“Kindly do that.”

The next inquiries were as to the machine the firm had bought, and
Pentecost described it as well as he could and offered to have the
blueprints sent over from New York—an offer which was accepted. He was
unable, when asked, to give any information concerning Augustus Findlay
as he’d never seen him nor even heard his name mentioned, nor could he
tell the Inspector anything about the butler, Dreek, as he’d only seen
him once or twice in the performance of his duties and once when he
was called in to sign as a witness.... Yes, he should say it was quite
possible this butler, Dreek, had seen the bunch of money.... No, he had
no idea how it happened that Mr. Haworth had sent to a New York agency
for a butler.

Shortly after that he was excused, the Inspector intimating that he’d
like to have another chat with him in the near future.

Pentecost said of course—anything he could do, and added that if the
Inspector wanted to see Mr. Harker and his son Alfred—the two who were
with him at the Haworth place—he could get them over that night; but
he was told that such a thing was hardly necessary, as their testimony
could be taken in New York if it came to that.

“You got over here in quick time, Mr. Pentecost,” the Inspector was
moved to say as the interview was coming to a close. “We have to thank
you for that.”

“It was my business that was worrying me—not yours,” Pentecost
returned. “And now that you speak of it,” he went on, beginning to show
eagerness again, “I was advised to consult you as to how I could get
that machine out of the house. We’ve got a good-sized stack of money
invested in it and I’d like to get it into a safe place.”

“It’s perfectly safe where it is, Mr. Pentecost. We’ve got to hold it
till we can see what bearing—if any—it has on the case. Good afternoon.”

A plain-clothes man opened the door for him and Mr. Pentecost passed
out. When the man turned back into the room the Inspector spoke quickly
in an undertone: “Run out after him, Charlie, and keep him in sight
till I get someone on the job. Keep your distance—don’t let him get
wise to it.”

The detective addressed as Charlie disappeared through the door.

       *       *       *       *       *

The Inspector sat thinking a moment and then got to his feet and
began pacing the room—a habit of his when hunting for the answer to
something. He suddenly stopped and spoke to the plain-clothes man at
the table who’d been taking down the conversation with Pentecost.

“What did you think of that, Alec?”

“Sounded nice an’ slick to me.”

“Ever see him before?”

“Not as I remember.”

“Got an idea I have. Can’t place it. Going to put Loderer and Trench on
him.”

“Cinch on Findlay, ain’t it?”

“What you might call that, but there’s one or two curious things about
it—money gone—thirty-five thousand in bills—we can’t get that on
Findlay.”

“Nor on this man, either, that I can see. You can’t crack an alibi like
that, with the Purser an’ all talking to ’im on the voyage. And on top
of it he comes ashore from the steamer in New York this morning.”

The inspector muttered, “Yes, I know,” absently, and was silent a
moment, thinking. Finally he said with a slightly explosive effect:

“God! I hope Bellinger gets the man that phoned in here last night!”

“You mean about this Pentecost not being on board?”

“Yes—and advising us to have the boat watched in New York.”

“Nothing on it yet?”

“Nothing to the good. We got the booth he phoned from and we picked
up a man who saw a chap go into that booth about that time, but he
couldn’t give a description except that he looked like a day laborer of
some kind—so we don’t land anywhere.”

“What booth was it?”

“Nineteen——South Station.”




PART VII


You can readily understand that the daily papers, both morning and
evening, were going strong on this murder, giving the public all the
sensational stuff they could rake out of the gory mess. Even wild rumor
was sufficiently tamed to occupy a place of honor on first pages, no
least item of the appalling affair being too inconsequent to be written
up until it fairly bristled with significance.

Even at that, very little attention was given to a press dispatch from
Montreal which appeared in the Boston papers on the second morning
after the shooting. Only a few lines it amounted to, and tacked on at
the end of one of the columns devoted to the murder.

This dispatch stated as rather a striking coincidence, that one of the
Montreal papers of the day before—that is, of the morning following
the West Roxbury shooting—had printed in a local news column a short
paragraph to the effect that at a spirit séance in a private house on
Sackville Street the night before—which was the evening of the murder,
a call had come from the spirit of some one (a man it seemed to be)
whose name, owing to his extreme agitation, couldn’t be obtained, but
who was so insistent on speaking that the control brought him in.

The medium, who was in trance, suddenly taken by this spirit, began
crying out: “Stop them! Stop them! Can’t somebody stop them? Oh, it’s
terrible—terrible! They’re going right on—there’s no help for it!
Oh—can’t somebody telegraph?”

Then there was a pause, and some of the sitters began asking this
spirit what the trouble was, and where he wanted them to telegraph,
and what his name was, and things like that. But there was no answer,
and for several minutes nothing more came through. Then suddenly
there was something like a shout for help repeated several times and
followed by wild exclamations about killing some one. “Down in the
States—down in the States! Roxbury—down in the States! They’re killing
a man in Roxbury—killing a man. No one can stop it now! There’s a gun
aimed at him—don’t you understand—aiming a gun—aiming a——Oh, They’ve
shot him!... Now they’ve shot him again!... He’s sinking—sinking
down—down.... Now he’s on the floor—all in a heap!... Now he’s dead!...
Dead!... Dead...!” The words seemed to trail off in the distance toward
the end, and nothing more was heard from the perturbed visitor.

The Montreal paper carrying the account of this went on to say that its
information was obtained from a well-known person who had attended the
sitting. And one of the Boston papers, commenting on it briefly, as
one of those odd coincidences which come along and surprise us every
now and then, added: “This will be less astounding, however, when
we reflect that a medium in Canada or anywhere else can confidently
assert, at any hour of the day or night, that a murder is being
committed in one of the large cities of the United States, and not be
far out of the way in time or place.”

The evidence tending to establish the guilt of Augustus Findlay in
the case of the shooting to death of Charles Michael Haworth was so
overwhelming from the point of view of newspaper readers, that it
threatened to make the case uninteresting—a threat, however, which
was soon swept into the discard. For a few days, though, it looked
unpromising in the extreme to those who revel in newspaper sewerage.
The facts were so plain and Findlay’s guilt so evident that no room was
left for enthralling suspicions as to others—for gossip and scandal,
for the laying bare of nauseous details concerning the habits and
lives of loathsome people, and all those choice morsels of offal that
newspaper addicts go after so ravenously.

It was simply that this Findlay man, the murderer, had always been
threatening to put a bullet into the Haworth man, the murdered, and
had finally done so, being worked up to a sufficient frenzy in his
half-drunken condition, by finding the said Haworth calling upon
his—Findlay’s—wife. He had thereupon followed him home, flourishing a
revolver in his face most of the way and shouting the most murderous
threats and maledictions, and finally had shot him from outside the
Cripps mansion on Torrington Road (where Haworth lived) getting it
there through one of the front windows. Then he had run home and tried
to make his wife uphold him in his statement that he hadn’t left the
house all the evening. If that wasn’t enough to land him in the chair,
what was?

To the authorities, however, it wasn’t quite so easy navigation. No one
had seen Findlay do the deed; no revolver had been found; no bullet
marks in the room had yet been discovered. It was true that everything
pointed to him as the murderer, but pointing wasn’t enough. It answers
very nicely for the general public, but doesn’t go with a Grand Jury.

And there was that obstinate old woman who undoubtedly had intimate
knowledge of the entire episode from A to Z—knowing the persons
involved, the motives behind the murderous deed, and every circumstance
leading up to it;—for hadn’t she run out and warned a patrolman in
Jamaica Plain nearly a week before the event? Fully aware of this
and more, yet keeping her mouth as securely closed as if officially
padlocked. More important still if it was a fact—and a word or two
she’d dropped just after the shooting made it look that way—she’d been
an eyewitness of the murder. Yet so far nothing could be got out of her
on the subject.

But no mistake was made about Amelia Temple. It was seen from the first
that the only chance was in giving it to her easy and waiting patiently
for results. No pressure. On a sign of that she’d have cheerfully gone
to prison for life or permitted herself to be hung by the neck until
dead, before she’d have let out a word. So they kept careful watch on
her without interfering in any way with her freedom or giving her the
least idea they were doing it.

And the Inspector and she enjoyed a couple of pleasant conversations
during this time, in which, “as a matter of form” he gave her the
opportunity to enlighten them as to one or two little things, but
said himself she was perfectly justified in declining to do so if she
still felt that she must—indeed, he wasn’t sure but he’d do the same
in her place. And the patrolman who’d failed to respond to her request
for help had (under instructions, of course) made her a most abject
apology, to which her only response was, “That does a lot o’ good
_now_, don’t it?”

       *       *       *       *       *

While proceedings in this quarter were at a standstill (for they
wanted to give the old woman time), those in other and unexpected
directions were not. Some rather unusual phenomena relating to the case
were beginning to attract attention. Although the first of these—the
communication that came through a Montreal medium—had hardly caused
a ripple, a manifestation on similar lines now broke out in Boston
itself, and people began to sit up and take notice.

The séance in which this occurred was taking place in a small hall or
conference room, where a committee appointed by some sort of psychical
research society was investigating the spirit manifestations claimed
to be produced by a certain medium. It was a lady in this case—using
the term merely as indicative of sex (though for all I know it could be
applied in a broader sense as well)—and she was trying to cope with the
various tests to which this committee was subjecting her at a series
of meetings held for that purpose, hoping to win a prize that had been
offered; but sure, in any event, of valuable publicity.

As you see, I am fairly well uninformed as to the interior workings of
this particular brand of religious endeavor—if it may be referred to as
such. Nevertheless, I am fully aware of the phenomena that touched on
the Haworth case, and can report them to you with a close approach to
accuracy, leaving you to draw your own conclusions as to their origin.

It was certainly a great surprise to everyone interested in the
affair—with the possible exception of the firm of Harker & Pentecost,
neither member of which was ever surprised at anything—that an attempt
at interference should come from such a quarter. For a time it was
treated as an absurdity not worth serious attention. But that was only
for a time.

It seems that mediums, being forbidden, in these enlightened days, to
give public séances for which admission fees are charged, are obliged
to employ other methods of attracting and doing business. The most
common is to appear before the congregations in the great Spiritist
temples—or whatever name they may go by—where meetings are held at
stated intervals in all the large cities and many of the smaller ones.
At these gatherings a limited number of “inspirational speakers” and
“test mediums” are allowed a certain time each in which to bring the
spirits of the departed into communication with friends or relatives
present, and sometimes with people who cannot be found in the assembly.

The more striking and convincing the feats these inspirational
individuals perform, the greater will be their renown and ultimate
pecuniary reward. For upon the impression made at these meetings (where
no admission fee is charged) largely depends the amount and the value
of the private business they can do thereafter. It has been known that
one extraordinary “demonstration” in the way of spirit communication
or materialization, has come near to making the fortune of the artist
(using the term with entire respect) who brought it about. The field
is of vast extent. The highest aim is the convincing and consequent
conversion of persons of wealth who are undergoing the pangs of recent
bereavement; for the successful medium deals in that for which almost
anything will be paid—if the believing client has the price.

While these appearances at the great Spiritist assemblies are the
most used of the publicity methods for commercial mediums, a greatly
superior one has recently been developed for the few who are fortunate
enough to be able to associate themselves with it. It is one of the
innumerable outcomes—all more or less revolting—of what a few nations
egotistically refer to as “the World War.”

Owing to this absurd and ghastly occurrence, hundreds of
thousands—perhaps millions—of families were suddenly plunged into the
most heartrending grief known to man. Those who were beyond words dear
to them had been snatched away and violently put to death, and the
ones so taken were in the very part of life where death seems most
impossible, most unbelievable, and consequently most terrible.

Resulting from this, the interest in that creed which assures people
that their lost ones are yet here with them in spirit form, trying
to speak to them and often succeeding (through the mediumship of
others), even on occasion appearing before them in person (again
through the interposition of others), was suddenly and tremendously
increased. One result was an enormous enlargement in the number of
believers, among which were included some with a high order of mental
equipment—something in which this “faith” had been painfully deficient
before. A result of the unprecedented interest which this accession to
the ranks of Spiritists inspired, was a stimulation of the efforts made
by the less credulous to learn whether or not there existed grounds for
confidence in the amazing claims set forth. Societies and associations
and investigating committees were organized for this purpose in
various parts of the country, rewards were offered and the claims and
accomplishments of various mediums were subjected to investigation.
As a by-product of these activities, and one, it must be admitted,
wholly unlooked for by those undertaking this enthusiastic search for
truth, the most effective machinery yet devised for the manufacture of
publicity for mediums was put in operation.

The prize of a few thousand dollars offered by the organizations
behind the investigating committees, was as nothing to the enormously
increased business for the medium which was sure to follow the
newspaper accounts of the proceedings, no matter which way they went or
what decision was arrived at. Free newspaper publicity, and in the news
columns—that was the real prize.

       *       *       *       *       *

It happened that an investigation of this kind was going on in Boston
at the time of the tragic occurrence on Torrington Road. The medium
who was undergoing tests was a Mrs. Belden—Henrietta E. Belden was the
entire name I believe—and she had heretofore revealed her unusual gifts
only in private—that is to say, in her own home out in Quincy. But
accounts of the extraordinary things that took place when she went into
trance, came to the notice of members of a research society, and after
a bit of wirepulling that was kept in the dark (as it certainly should
have been) the lady was invited to submit to a series of test sittings,
and, I need hardly say, accepted.

The first test séance had already been held and with some
success—enough to get half-column reports of it on inside pages of
most of the next day’s papers. But this was only a beginning.

On the evening of the day after the murder in Torrington Road, the
second sitting was scheduled to take place—which it did. Most of the
newspaper reports of this meeting spoke of it as being unsatisfactory
in the extreme, though one or two contended that it would be only fair
to the medium to suspend judgment until the next one, as there appeared
to be some unexplained obstacle in her way, and she should be given a
chance to overcome it.

It seems that after Mrs. Belden had gone into trance, instead of being,
as on the first occasion, immediately controlled by energetic spirits
who spoke volubly (through her) and caused sounds of knockings and
chilly draughts and inexplicable moving of furniture, she was suddenly
plunged by some mysterious influence, into the most overpowering grief,
begging piteously that some one would help her. On questioning by
members of the committee, it developed that they were speaking to the
spirit of a woman named Cynthia. That is to say, the medium herself
had disappeared into trance, and the spirit of this Cynthia woman was
speaking through Mrs. Belden’s terrestrial machinery.

“Cynthia—I’m Cynthia!” the medium kept calling out in a voice entirely
different from her own, and with tears running down her cheeks.
“Yes—Cynthia! Oh, won’t somebody help me! Though you don’t know me, for
God’s sake help me! Isn’t there somebody here who can do _something_?”
And the medium sobbed and moaned and rocked back and forth, and her
very face was changed. All the questions that were put to her by the
members of the committee seemed to get them no further. The Cynthia
spirit was apparently crazed with grief or anxiety, and held her place
for nearly an hour, begging for help, yet leaving those present without
information as to what the trouble was, further than the little that
could be gathered from her incoherent cries of: “Oh—they’ve made a
terrible mistake! Don’t you see—a terrible, frightful mistake!”

“Mistake about what, madam?” would come in a sharp incisive voice from
an investigator.

“About him—about him. He’s my son—my son—my son! Don’t you
understand?—and he’s in such trouble—oh, _such_ trouble! It’s all
wrong—all wrong! Can’t somebody go and tell them it’s all a mistake!
Oh, please somebody tell them!” And thus it went on, the grief-stricken
spirit of Cynthia hysterically begging for assistance and imploring
them to tell somebody that something wasn’t so, yet seemingly unable
to furnish information as to what persons she wished to have told,
or to let them know who she was herself. And although, after some
little time of this, the members of the committee urgently requested
Cynthia’s spirit to leave the medium so that the spirits of others who
were better able to communicate might take her place, she couldn’t be
persuaded to do so.

Even Mrs. Belden’s assistant or director—or whatever it is those people
are called—joined in the efforts to persuade Cynthia to release the
medium, calling out several times to the usual spirit control: “Doctor
Coulter, can’t you relieve this situation? Tell us what this Cynthia
woman wants or take her away.”

But nothing availed and the investigation was finally adjourned until
the evening after the next.

When Mrs. Belden came out of the trance and began to take notice
of things, she discovered, from the behavior of those members of
the committee who had waited, that all was not well. Her director
whispered a few hurried words to her, and she could be heard
exclaiming, “Cynthia? Why—why, what does it mean? I don’t know anybody
named Cynthia—I never heard of such a person!” She appeared greatly
disturbed, evidently fearing her chances of winning the prize which
had been offered for a successful test were gone, or at least greatly
reduced in size.

The condition in which she was left after being under the control of
this sorrowful spirit for more than an hour, was surely bad enough
without the added anxiety as to the failure of the test. One or two of
the gentlemen shook hands with her and said she mustn’t take it so much
to heart, as the next meeting would undoubtedly be a fine one and more
than make up for any shortcomings in this. But it was evident that Mrs.
Belden was disappointed and chagrined.

       *       *       *       *       *

The next sitting was approached with feelings bordering on trepidation
of one sort or another by nearly everyone concerned. And when Mrs.
Belden had finally succeeded—with more difficulty than usual—in getting
herself into trance condition, and almost immediately thereafter
the tearful voice of Cynthia was heard, the depression among the
investigators became acute.

But there was a surprise awaiting them, for not only was this spirit
calmer and more reasonable than she had been two nights before, but she
spoke in a way that aroused a sudden and peculiar interest.

The Haworth case—barely three days old and still on the front pages—was
the subject of conversation everywhere. So that when the members
of the committee became aware—as they did from the first few words
spoken—that it was the spirit of Cynthia Findlay addressing them,—the
mother of the man arrested for the Haworth murder, and as to whose
guilt there wasn’t a remnant of doubt in the public mind—the deepest
interest was aroused. Her voice was still sad and occasionally
tremulous with emotion, but there was no more sobbing and hysteria.
She begged most piteously that somebody there would tell the Judge or
the Jury or the police or some one, that her son was innocent. It was
all a dreadful mistake. He——Oh no! Oh, believe her, no!—he wasn’t the
one who did it! All the things that looked so terribly incriminating
could be accounted for some other way. Every one of them could be
explained!—Every one!—Every one!

She went on like that for quite a time, becoming more and more affected
until she could hardly speak. But on this occasion her repetitions—even
her paroxysms of emotion—were no longer wearisome to those present.

As soon as it became necessary for her to pause for breath—for while
it’s more than unlikely that a spirit needs any, the same could hardly
be said of a medium—a flood of incisive questioning poured in, which
ran something like this:

PROFESSOR ELBERTSON (_a psychologist_): “Mrs. Findlay, if you know your
son did not commit the crime he’s charged with, you must also know who
did.”

MR. BLATCHFORD (_an attorney_): “Certainly. Your knowledge implies
that you are in a position where you have an insight of the case. This
insight should enable you to give us the name of the guilty one.”

THE SPIRIT: “Oh, don’t ask me! I can’t—I can’t!”

DOCTOR WINGATE (_a physician_): “Who prevents you? Who stops you when
so much depends on it? Let us know who this person—this spirit—is.”

THE SPIRIT: “There’s no ‘who.’ Nothing can be said—no words—no—no—no
words!”

MR. HALSTED (_a prestidigitator_): “Do you mean, Mrs. Findlay, that
there is no person or being or entity of any description who forbids
you or stands in the way of your telling us this?”

THE SPIRIT: “No such thing as that! I am held by an influence from all
that is, of which I myself am an infinitesimal part.”

MR. BLATCHFORD: “Then why does not this prohibitive influence prevent
you from informing us as to your son? You experience no difficulty in
declaring his innocence. Is it a law that operates either way according
to its fancy?”

THE SPIRIT: “My own influence, though infinitesimal as a rule, becomes
of more consequence than all others when it concerns my son, and the
balance is turned. For him I can speak across to you and beg you to
save him.”

MR. BLATCHFORD: “Then surely for him you can reveal the facts that will
accomplish that result.”

THE SPIRIT: “Perhaps I can—oh, perhaps—perhaps! But it can’t be now! If
it can be—I’ll come again!” The voice trailed away in a despairing moan
and the spirit of Cynthia was gone.

Mrs. Belden came out of the trance rather suddenly, rubbing her eyes
and glancing questioningly at her director and the members of the
committee. As before, she seemed greatly exhausted by the use to
which the spirit of Cynthia had put her, and found herself in a cold
perspiration.

While no real test had yet been furnished by Mrs. Belden, a majority
of the committee had a feeling that the next visit of the spirit of
Cynthia would supply one, while a pessimistic minority openly stated
that there wouldn’t be any next visit,—that the questioning they had
given her would keep her occupied in other spheres, and that it was an
exceedingly good way to be rid of her.

Mediumistic episodes such as this wouldn’t get a thing from the
papers under ordinary circumstances. But these investigations the
psychical research people put over, excited enough public interest to
be taken up by the Associated Press and run all over the country. And
this alleged appearance of the grief-stricken spirit of the mother
of Augustus Findlay, the man who was under arrest for the murder of
Charles Haworth, was featured in all the morning editions from Maine to
California and Montreal to New Orleans.

       *       *       *       *       *

On the day following the publication of these reports, quite a pack
of editors got after it as a specimen of the gullibility of the human
race in general and the people who took part in such “goings-on” in
particular. You can see how the free advertising piles up for them in
cases like this. Even the high and mighty editors push it along!

Of course there was nothing in it for the police—not even enough to
laugh at—and no attention was paid to the matter. It wasn’t even
recognized as having occurred.

Mr. Forbes, the Defense Attorney, read the accounts of the séance with
a grimace. While entirely willing to catch at a straw in this case, he
failed to see anything in the alleged appearance of the spirit of his
client’s mother that could be dignified by such an appellation.

But in the evening of the day following there happened something that
every one of these persons did pay attention to, not to speak of
millions of newspaper readers besides.

It seems that a well-known medium named Dillingworth was having his
chance at one of the meetings of a Spiritist convention that was in
progress at Lilly Dale, a village not far from Chautauqua, in the
westernmost county of New York State, where gatherings of this nature
occur at intervals (no admission charged). Mr. Dillingworth was calling
out names and descriptions of spirit forms that appeared to him, and
asking if anyone in the audience recognized them as departed relatives
or friends. Some one, of course, nearly always did, and thereupon would
follow affectionate messages and disjointed conversations between
the living and the dead, carried on from the dead side through the
mediumship of Mr. Dillingworth.

This sort of thing went on for something like half the medium’s
allotted time, when suddenly he seemed to be strangely affected,
and unable for a moment to proceed. He soon recovered, however, and
half apologizing, told the assembly that some one had come who had a
peculiar sort of influence—an oldish man, it was, who kept saying that
he didn’t know anyone there but couldn’t get control in other places,
and very much wanted a message sent to some one.

“Yes, a—a—damnably important message,” went on the medium abstractedly,
as though trying to listen to something in the distance. “But I can’t
seem to get his name.... Oh—says he doesn’t care to give it.... But
we can hardly send a message unless we know who it’s from!” (Trying
to hear.) “How do you spell it? C—r—i—p—p—Crippen? ... Oh, Cripps.
His name is Cripps—quite an old gentleman—rather portly—medium
height—gray-blue eyes—smooth face—grizzled gray hair—bushy dark
eyebrows. Anyone here know such a person? Wait a minute!... Yes
yes, Mr. Cripps, I know you told me no one knew you, but I’m so
used to asking the question——What?... He’s using the most frightful
language!... All right—all right—there’s no need of getting huffy about
it! Give us the message.... He says it’s to the police somewhere—I
can’t get the place. Yes, go on, Mr. Cripps.... R-o-x-b-u-r—Oh,
Roxbury!... Man shot there, he says—murdered. ... _Boston_ police? Why
not the police where the man was shot?... Oh I see—a part of Boston. I
didn’t know that.... Yes, I guess you’re right, Mr. Cripps!... He says
my geography isn’t worth a God-forsaken damn!... Very well, the Boston
police. Now what’s the message?... Let me get that straight! We’re to
send word that both times—is that right?—both times their detectives
examined the inside of the rain-water conductor on the south side
of the front portico they didn’t reach high enough up. Is that all,
Mr. Cripps?... But you haven’t mentioned what it is they’re reaching
for.... What?... Oh, I see!... He says they’ll know damned well—and
don’t you forget it!... All right, Mr. Cripps. That’s pretty strong
language, but we’ll try not to forget it.... What’s that? Yes, we’ll
tell them.... He says they’d better be careful how they handle it if
the finger marks on the butt are any use to them.... But can’t you tell
us, Mr. Cripps, whether the—What?... Who’s this speaking?... Oh, some
one else! Just a minute.” Then, glancing toward the audience and in a
lower voice: “Will somebody remember that message? I don’t know what
it’s all about, but if it’s going to help the Boston police any, God
knows they ought to have it!”

A roar of laughter, together with some vigorous hissing, followed this
last remark, which could hardly excite surprise when one reflected
on the derision and contempt which had been aroused by the peculiar
behavior of the organization referred to not a great while before.

Though the medium, Mr. Dillingworth, didn’t know what it was all about,
the bunch of reporters sitting at a table down in front of him, did. In
forty-five minutes the Associated Press had the whole thing, and before
midnight newspaper men were dashing madly out to Jamaica Plain, having
obtained permission to look over the ground.

The outcome of all this was that along about 1:30 in the morning half
a dozen chaps from the papers were gathered round the rain-water
conductor on the front of the Cripps mansion, pushing wires and small
rods up from the lower end. But nothing was found—which wasn’t so
very surprising when you take into consideration that headquarters
had received a rush dispatch fully an hour before the papers got it,
giving the spirit message from old Mr. Cripps in full. No one in the
Department had any confidence in it—unadulterated rot, all these spirit
stunts. Still, when it was wired over on a “rush” from Lilly Dale and
signed “H. Thompson, Sergeant State Police,” what was the good of
taking chances? So the Inspector hustled a couple of plain-clothes men
out to the mansion with orders to take another look up the water pipe.

It was ten minutes after the detectives arrived at the mansion that
they pulled Augustus Findlay’s revolver down out of the large zinc
water conductor up which it had been shoved to a height of several
feet, and wedged in with a branch from a shrub to hold it there. They
got a grip on it with hooks and wires so that nobody’s hands came in
contact with it. Two chambers of the gun were empty.

As the Boston papers had no knowledge of this, the dispatch from Lilly
Dale was used inconspicuously in most of them, followed by the brief
statement that reporters had been out and searched, but that nothing
was found in the locality mentioned. Papers elsewhere gave it more
prominence, as it was too late to hit them with the news that the
search made by the reporters had been in vain.

       *       *       *       *       *

This new evidence—Findlay’s revolver found hidden near the place
where the crime was committed, with two of the chambers empty and his
fingerprints showing up nicely on the handle—was of the utmost value,
though they’d most likely have got an indictment without it. But while
it made the action of the Grand Jury a certainty, and would be damning
evidence when it came to trial, it must be confessed that the views of
the Chief Inspector and of the Assistant District Attorney who was to
prosecute, were a trifle unsettled by the source of the information
which had led to its discovery. It was certainly not an agreeable
position to be placed in, and every effort must be made to keep the
matter quiet. Luckily the presentation of the evidence before the Grand
Jury would be behind closed doors, and by the time it had come up at
the trial people would probably have forgotten what it was all about.

On the following day Assistant District Attorney McVeigh went before
the Grand Jury and the indictment of Augustus Cripps Findlay for the
murder of Charles Michael Haworth was handed down without delay.

       *       *       *       *       *

The date which had been set for Mrs. Henrietta E. Belden’s final
séance before the researching committee, fell on the third day after
the indictment of Findlay. Many persons not connected in any way with
this committee made strenuous efforts to gain admission, but without
success. Representatives of the press were present, but the public had
been excluded from the beginning.

So when, upon the assembling of the committee on that evening, it was
discovered that a meek-looking person who was not a member, nor a
reporter from any of the papers, was seated near the door, inquiries
were at once made, and the whispered reply of the chairman was that the
stranger was from the office of the Chief of Police. For what purpose
he had been sent, he (the chairman) had not been informed. So far as he
was aware, they hadn’t been violating any police regulations.

As on the two preceding occasions, the spirit of Cynthia took immediate
possession of the medium, but she appeared to be laboring under an
excitement so intense that it was with difficulty she could articulate,
and more than half an hour went by before anything came through that
could be understood.

This incoherency and delay did not, however, have the discouraging
effect which it had on a former occasion, for everyone there was intent
to hear, held so by the feeling that she had something important to
tell if only she could get it across. She would start on something—it
seemed to be some number she was trying to give them—and then break
off with: “I will—I will—I WILL!” repeated again and again.

The committee members were doing what they could to help her along,
and when one of them asked, “Is some one preventing you from telling
us?” the vehement answer came back: “Yes—yes! Such forces against
me!—I can hardly speak! Don’t go away—don’t go away!” And then all was
confusion again, in the midst of which she tried repeatedly to tell the
number. Finally, after many interruptions, she got it out—four hundred
ninety-one, four hundred ninety-one, and went on repeating it, but
still apparently unable to explain its present significance. But after
a long struggle to overcome the obstacle, whatever it was, something
seemed suddenly to release the spirit of Cynthia from what had the
effect of a strangle hold, and she almost screamed out: “West side of
the street! West! West! Four hundred ninety-one!”

As soon as she stopped repeating this long enough for anyone to speak,
every effort was made to get from her the name of the street she was
talking about. She was asked what part of the town—what buildings were
on it—the first letter of its name—everything the committee members
could think of that might be a clue.

The forces holding her back began to weaken from the time she managed
to shriek out about the west side of the street, and the whole thing
came through rather suddenly a few minutes later.

“Don’t forget—don’t forget—four hundred ninety-one Collamore
Street—four hundred ninety-one Collamore Street—west side—west side—man
smoking a pipe—west side of Collamore Street—he saw them take it away
from him. Oh, get him—somebody go and get him—he saw it all!”

Even while this was being repeated (as it was a number of times) there
was the beginning of a quiet and unobtrusive movement by some of the
newspaper men toward the door. But they found the meek and inoffensive
person from the office of the chief of police standing before it and
pulling his coat back the merest trifle so that the edge of his badge
could be seen.

“Sorry but you’ll have to wait a minute, gentlemen,” he said in an
undertone, and before the reporters recovered from their astonishment
he slipped through the door. The indignant journalists started to
follow him, but they found a bulky patrolman just outside who declined
to let them pass. The only reply to their furious questions was,
“Orders.”

       *       *       *       *       *

It was a great surprise to James Rathbun, who lived with his family on
the second floor of 491 Collamore Street, Roxbury district, and was
employed in a ladies’ boot and shoe factory near the railroad, to be
roused from bed when he’d scarcely more than gone to it, and questioned
by a couple of men who appeared to be ordinary citizens, but were
accompanied by the patrolman on that beat.

No, he didn’t know anything at all about the murder over to Torrington
Road, excepting what he’d seen in the papers.... Sure he’d read about
it.... No, he didn’t know anyone concerned in it and hadn’t seen any
of them so far as he was aware of. They must have got the wrong place,
hadn’t they?... He couldn’t say as he remembered of anything special
happening around there on the night of the murder.... No, he hadn’t
noticed anyone taking anything away from anybody that night—unless
they—unless——Why hold on now! There _was_ a kind of a fight down in the
street, now he came to think of it, and he’d gone down and tried to
stop it, but it was about as good as over when he got there. But now
they were speaking about taking away something from somebody, maybe
that was what they meant.... No, not money or a watch, it wasn’t, but
the other feller’s gun.... No, he hadn’t any idea at all who they
was.... Sure, he’d go to the Inspector’s office if they wanted him to,
but there wasn’t much of anything to it so far as he could see.

The Inspector, it seems, was at the Charles Street jail, and Mr.
Rathbun was taken there and questioned in one of the rooms. His
testimony, as brought out, was straight and simple. He had come home
rather late that night—about half-past ten or so he should say—and
was smoking a pipe at his window facing the street. All of a sudden
he heard a lot of scuffling and cursing outside, and looking out saw
two men down there near one of the street lamps wrestling around and
jabbing each other. There was something shining that they both had
hold of, and once when it got out into the light he could see one man
was holding on to it by the nozzle and trying to get it away from the
other. That one had gloves on.... No, the other chap didn’t have none.
He (Rathbun) yelled out to ’em from the window, but they was at it like
two dogs holding to a stick, so he went downstairs to the street door
and opened it, and just at that minute the man that had the gloves on
give the other fellow a paste in the face that made him loosen his grip
for a second so he could snatch the gun away from him and run up the
street with it.... Yes, he was sure it was the one with the gloves on
that got the gun.... How did he _know_? Well, for one thing he went out
and spoke to the other chap and he didn’t have none on.... No, there
wasn’t any talk between them, for the chap didn’t say anything, but in
a minute or so turned suddenly and beat it down the street toward the
railroad tracks.... _Know_ him? Did the Inspector mean the one he went
out and spoke to? Sure he’d know him if he ever saw him again!

“Why, there he is now!” Rathbun exclaimed with genuine surprise, as he
pointed at a man among about a dozen prisoners who were filing into
the room. It was Augustus Findlay. The Inspector had given a signal a
moment before.

       *       *       *       *       *

The digging up of James Rathbun of 491 Collamore Street on a tip from
the disembodied spirit of Cynthia Cripps Findlay shook things up a
bit in the Police Department. Of course everyone connected with said
Department was entirely aware that the spirit game was simply cheap
poppycock and that the two rather surprising messages bearing on the
Haworth case were merely instances of odd coincidence. Great God! There
were eleven thousand mediums in the United States, and these giving
out ten communications a day (a conservative estimate) made the output
from the spirits forty million one hundred and fifty thousand messages
a year; it would be a damned pity if one or two of them couldn’t strike
it right once in a while! As for the alleged Cripps message from Lilly
Dale, they had it pretty well covered up—at least for the present. The
papers, to be sure, had printed it, but they had also mentioned the
fact that nothing could be found in the place indicated.

But holding back this Collamore Street message with its extraordinary
results was another matter. It must be done though, if possible. The
precaution of ordering the detention of everybody in the hall where the
séance was held, in case some “spirit” got a message through that might
cause trouble, was certainly well taken, and neither the reporters
nor any others who’d been present during Mrs. Belden’s trance were
permitted to leave the building until Mr. Rathbun had been returned to
his dwelling place and, with his wife (who’d come to the window the
night of the fight on hearing the shouting) sworn to keep the matter
entirely to themselves, and the fact strongly impressed upon them that
it would be a highly dangerous thing _for them_, to let out a word of
it.

A search was quickly made for others in the tenements near who might
have been witnesses to the revolver fight, but none were found. All
this had transpired in not much above an hour, and the Rathbuns, as
requested, locked their door and went to bed.

Some twenty minutes thereafter No. 491 Collamore Street was seething
with baffled newspaper men. They pounded on the door and rang the bell
of the tenement on the second floor, until Mr. Rathbun, apparently
roused from deep slumber, opened it to find out what all the racket was
about.

The reporters surged about him, calling out questions, demanding
statements, jotting down descriptions of him, and making such a riotous
clamor, notwithstanding his assurances that he didn’t know anything
about it, that he finally (to all appearances) lost his temper, and
shoving those nearest to him back on to the landing, slammed the door
in their faces and turned the key in the lock.

By this time there was quite a gathering in the street below, and
when the newspaper boys began to surge down the stairs with the idea
of trying to get in through a rear entrance, there was considerable
excitement; for the crowd hadn’t the least idea what it was all about
and looked for the capture of a desperate burglar or something equally
diverting. In the midst of all this, word was suddenly passed from
somewhere that some one had found a man up the street a ways, who’d
seen the whole thing, and in ten seconds No. 491 was left as quiet as a
church.

The rumor of the man who knew it all turned out to be based on fact. A
solid, reliable-looking chap he was, and the reporters had him penned.
He seemed reluctant to say anything at first, but finally admitted
that he was walking through Collamore Street that night and came right
on it. Must have been half-past ten or eleven, he thought. Two men
fighting for a revolver—that’s all it was. He backed into a doorway on
the other side, about opposite 491, and took it all in. The reporters
got everything down to the minutest details, and you can imagine what
the papers looked like next morning. Not Boston alone, but everywhere.
Headlines you could read a block away. Here was the real thing, and the
newspaper chaps know one of those when they see it.

The authorities laid the leakage to the Rathbuns, but of course
couldn’t hold them for anything. When they came to figure up the effect
of the revolver episode on the case, it didn’t alter matters to any
extent. While it had the look of some kind of framing of Findlay,
it was at the same time shown by this very episode that he had his
revolver in his hands after the shooting and was chasing himself
home with it at the time it was taken from him. The only real loss
sustained by the prosecution was the necessary abandonment of the
contention that Findlay’s revolver had been concealed by himself after
the shooting, for, as it now appeared, somebody else had shoved it up
in the water conductor. But without this, the evidence against the man
was amply sufficient. His violent threats—his frenzy at being shoved
back out of the house by Haworth with the door slammed in his face—his
position at the front window with his gun in his hand at the instant
of the shooting—his mad flight from the grounds of the Cripps mansion,
carrying (as it now appeared) his weapon with him—his incriminating
behavior at the time of his arrest next morning in attempting to escape
and then, when caught, endeavoring to get his wife to support him in
his statement that he hadn’t left the house the evening before—all
this, taken together with other evidence which had since been
collected, meant nothing but swift conviction.

But while the Chief Inspector and the District Attorney entertained
no doubts as to the case against Findlay so far as the actual firing
of the shots that killed his victim was concerned, this extraordinary
seizure of the revolver in the public street and its concealment
near the place where the murder had been committed, were a plain
indication that others were involved in the crime, and now that it was
accomplished, were using every effort to frame it on him alone. It was
a strong hand that was working in the dark against Findlay, and Mrs.
Belden, the spirit medium, had shown that she knew a great deal about
it. She’d been held, after the release of the others, at the room where
the séance took place, notwithstanding the indignant protests of the
committee; and orders were later given to bring her to headquarters.
They’d soon make her tell where she got her information—a key, most
likely, to the whole thing.

They’d have liked very well to get Mr. Dillingworth, too—the Lilly Dale
medium whose control, alleged to be old Mr. Cripps, told where the gun
was concealed. But that would be difficult. And then again a man wasn’t
so easy to handle in a case like this. They could frighten a woman.
She’d lose her head and tell them everything.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mrs. Belden was brought in by a couple of detectives. It was somewhere
about three in the morning. Notwithstanding what she’d been through
and her virtual arrest coming on top of it—for that’s what it was made
to appear—she showed no signs of disturbance; indeed one would have
thought she hardly noticed what was going on. She had, or assumed, a
detached air, giving the impression that her mind was occupied with
other and more important things than those in the immediate vicinity. A
pleasant but vacant smile had been arranged on her countenance before
her thoughts wandered abroad, as a friendly signal to those who might
notice it fluttering there.

She was brought before the Inspector. Several plain-clothes men stood
about, watching her like hungry wolves. Uniformed police were stationed
at each door and a very large-sized one sat near the Inspector. She was
to be impressed with the importance of what was about to occur.

A detective brought her a chair.

All went smoothly enough as to preliminary questions—name, address,
occupation, etc.—although she replied absently, and several times
had to be recalled to herself and the question repeated before they
could get a response. After this was over and an effective pause had
followed, a police stenographer (plain-clothes) rose, and read in a
loud and impressive voice a report of what Mrs. Belden had said and
done during the séance of the evening just passed, while under the
alleged control of some one deceased.

The moment this man announced what the report was about, that he
intended to read, Mrs. Belden’s manner underwent a drastic change. Her
detachment disappeared, and evidences of the most eager interest took
its place. She listened with rapt attention to every word that had come
through from Cynthia, and when the reading was finished breathed a sigh
of the deepest satisfaction.

“Mrs. Belden, you have heard the report of what was given out and said
and uttered by you at the meeting held in the Board Room at Charnley’s
this evening?”

“What sir?” she asked with a startled turn, aroused from her thoughts
of the séance.

“I say” (in a louder voice) “you have _heard_ what has just been
read—the report of what you gave out at a Spiritualistic meeting this
past evening?”

“Oh yes——yes indeed! How nice of you to put it all down!”

“And do you acknowledge it to be a true and correct statement of your
words on that occasion?”

“Mercy! I’m sure I don’t know!”

“You don’t _know_?”

“Why no,” (shaking her head). “How could I when I was in trance?”

“In what?”

“Trance.”

“What in God’s name is that?”

“I—I really couldn’t tell. Why don’t you ask some of the committee?
That’s what they’re trying to find out. I’m sure they’d be glad to——”

“One moment! Just one moment, madam!” spoke up a large man in uniform
who was standing near the inspector. He wore a face and jowl something
like Von Hindenburg and his voice was as the bellowing of a bull.
“We’re here to ask _you_, Mrs. Belden! _You_ are the person who uttered
those words and we propose to hold you responsible!”

“What the hell’s the committee got to do with it, anyway?” growled one
of the detectives, whose natural gifts for vicious snarling had made
him of value in a business like this. “It was you who said it—now you
answer for it—see?”

Mrs. Belden blinked from one to another of them in cheerful
bewilderment. Her pleasant and comfortable smile still occupied her
face, though for a moment a trifle insecurely.

“Now then,” went on the Inspector, “we’d like very much to hear from
you, Mrs. Belden!”

When he spoke she turned to him as though to a pleasing conversation
with some new-found friend.

“Be so good as to answer the question.”

“The question?”

“Yes, the question!”

“Oh, I’m _so_ sorry, but I’m afraid I don’t remember what it was!”

“Don’t remember! Don’t remember! Well, I’ll be damned!” (From the
snarling one.)

“Perfectly plain and simple, madam,” continued the Inspector. “Is this
report which has just been read to you a true and correct statement
of the words spoken by you at the séance or meeting this evening just
passed?”

“Oh dear me—but you see, I—I don’t know.”

“You know what you _said_, don’t you?”

“No sir.”

“What’s the reason you don’t?” (Von Hindenburg speaking.) “Give us the
reason! Don’t try to put over any of that trance cackle on us! Don’t
you know what you say to people?”

“Oh, no!” (shaking her head). “Not when I’m in—in——not when it’s like
that.”

“Mrs. Belden, aren’t you perfectly well aware that you told those
present in the room to go to a certain street and number and get a man
who was living there, for a witness?”

“Yes sir.”

“A——h!” (A snarling roar.) “At last you’re beginning to remember, are
you?”

“No sir, I don’t remember.”

“You don’t!”

“No sir.”

“Then how do you know it?”

“I heard that man over there read it.”

“And did you remember then—when you heard him read it—that you’d said
it?”

“Why, I’m sorry, but I didn’t really remember having done so. I hope
you—I hope you won’t mind.”

“Whether you remember or not, Mrs. Belden, the fact that you did
actually tell them this, remains!”

“Oh yes indeed, that remains of course!” She wanted to oblige these
shouting and excited men in any way she could.

“Now then! You fully believe this to be the case—that you told them to
go to the address on Collamore Street, and find a man who was smoking a
pipe there, and bring him in for a witness?”

“Oh yes, I _do_ believe it, really!”

“Ah—you do! Well _that’s_ something!”

“Why, I don’t see why that man” (looking at him) “should want to tell a
lie about it, do you? I’m sure he _looks_ honest!”

“Never mind how he looks. You acknowledge in our presence that you said
those words, or words to that effect—you admit that you _did_ give that
street and number. Now what we want to know is, where you got that
information?”

“Yes!” (From the snarling hyena man.) “Who told you? Where did you find
it out? _I say, where did you find it out?_”

“Find what out?”

“That a man living at four hundred ninety-one Collamore Street saw
something that made him a valuable witness. Where did you find that
out?”

“Oh, but you don’t understand at all—I didn’t find it out!”

“You _knew_ it, didn’t you?”

“Oh no, I really had no idea of it at all!”

“Here! Here!” from the Hindenburg man.

“My God woman” (from the hyena man) “you _said_ it—you acknowledged
it—we’ve got half a dozen witnesses who’ll swear to that!”

“Oh yes! Well, doesn’t that satisfy you?”

“It does not! You’re going to tell us where you got that tip! It came
from somewhere—that somewhere is what we’ll get out of you—and don’t
you make any mistake about that!”

Mrs. Belden, unable to comprehend, smiled vaguely at them as if hoping
to soothe and quiet them thereby.

“Answer me this: How could you tell them all that about Collamore
Street if you didn’t know it yourself?”

“I don’t know, but if you’ll ask one of the committee men——”

“Be quiet!” “That’s enough of that!” “Committee be damned!” And general
protests from the men in the room.

Mrs. Belden subsided pleasantly. Her smile flickered a little but
refused to go out.

“I’m not here to ask committee men,” the Inspector went on. “I’m here
to ask YOU!”

“That’s very nice of you, I’m sure!” (A little doubtfully.)

“And what’s more, you’re going to tell me! You’re going to tell me
where you got your information about that witness in Collamore Street
before you leave this place!”

“Oh, I hope I can—if you feel so about it!”

“Go on with it then! How came you to know anything about that witness
at four hundred ninety-one Collamore Street? How was that? Explain
yourself!”

“Why I thought I told you that I _didn’t_ know anything about him! What
funny questions you ask me!”

“But you acknowledge that you _told_ them about him—you acknowledge
that! Don’t you acknowledge that?”

“Oh yes indeed—I acknowledge that!”

“Well if you _told_ them about him you must _know_ about him! You can’t
tell a thing unless you _know_ it, can you?”

“Well, you see, when I’m in trance——”

(A burst of yells and imprecations from the men in the room.) “Don’t
give us any more of that!” the Inspector went on as soon as it was
quiet. “Just the idea out of your head that you can put that kind of
birdseed over on us! From now on no more trances and rappings and
slates and the whole bag of tricks! We know these games—every one of
’em, an’ they don’t go here! _They don’t go here, Mrs. Belden!_ Now you
tell me straight, where did you get that information about the witness
on Collamore Street?”

“I didn’t get it at all.”

“You mean you told them all that—told them just where to find a man—the
very street—the very number—the very apartment—the very pipe he
smoked—and didn’t know any of those things yourself?”

“Oh yes—it’s so strange, isn’t it! When I’m in a——”

“None o’ that now!” (From the Inspector, speaking above a general
murmur of protest from the police and detectives.)

Mrs. Belden smilingly held her peace.

The Inspector, McCurran, paused a moment in order to increase the
impressiveness of his next question.

“Mrs. Belden,” he began, in a lower voice and with overpowering
solemnity, “do you realize the position in which you are placing
yourself by your refusal to answer this question?”

“Why, I’m afraid you don’t like it at all!”

“Not _like_ it, madam! I can assure you that it’s a great deal worse
for you than NOT LIKING IT! We are compelled to conclude that for some
reason known only to yourself you are SHIELDING the person or persons
WHO ARE GUILTY OF THIS FIENDISH CRIME!”

“Dear me! Why, who do you think it is?”

“You apparently have no idea what such a thing may mean to you!”

“No sir.” (She was so interested that she was leaving her smile alone
to get along the best it could without her.) “I’m almost sure I
haven’t!”

“A person who shields one guilty of murder is an ACCESSORY AFTER THE
FACT!”

“Mercy! Am I—am I one of those?”

“It certainly begins to look like it, madam!”

“Why how _perfectly_ dreadful!”

“Now before you’re arrested and tried on that charge we’ll give you
one more chance to clear yourself! You understand—one more chance and
that’s the last!”

“Well that’s—I’m sure you’re very kind! Is it something you want me to
do?”

“That’s what it is, madam, and your only chance is to DO IT NOW! Tell
us where you got your information about the witness on Collamore
Street!”

“But how can I when I didn’t get it anywhere? It was whoever was in
control that had it. That man there who read it said Cynthia was the
name.”

“Well then, where did Cynthia get it?”

“Oh, well,” (the smile spreading) “I’d like to know that myself!”

And so it went on hour after hour, Mrs. Belden cheerful and unmoved,
her questioners more and more wearied; bored beyond words by her dense
and unshakable simplicity and maddened by her invulnerable smile;
until finally they had to give it up and tell her to go home. Smiling
pleasantly, she thanked them and said she’d enjoyed it very much.

Though it seemed that some mysterious person or persons—dead or
alive—were framing Augustus Findlay, the Grand Jury had indicted him
for murder, and the evidence against him was seemingly overwhelming.

As for Findlay himself, his state of mind was pitiable. He had no doubt
whatever that he had fired the shots that killed Charles Haworth, and
Mr. Forbes (of Houston, Forbes & McAllister), the Defense Attorney, had
all he could do to keep the frightened wretch from confessing in the
hope of having mercy shown him. A prospect of life imprisonment gave
him no uneasiness; what appalled him was the thought of death. And it
certainly looked black for him as the day set for his trial drew near.

Then late one night the Associated Press took a hand—or rather let
us say extended a hand—from the wind-swept reaches of Chicago. Mr.
Harcourt Sidney was a well-established materializing medium doing
business in that city. Through his efforts and ministrations some
remarkable spirit phenomena had taken place, and he had a choice and
well-to-do clientele—the well-to-do feature being by far the more
important one to him. This man Sidney was not only clever in the line
of materialization, but he was a trumpet medium as well, and many of
his other-world communicants appeared to find this an assistance in
getting through.

In the practice of his profession, as Mr. Sidney conducted it, there
would be specially arranged private meetings at the houses of those
belonging to the circle; and Mr. Sidney, securely tied into a plain
kitchen chair with stout ropes, and his thumbs and fingers wound
with easily breakable thread, would bring—or let us say persuade
to come—from the spirit world, many friends or relatives of those
present, so that they seemed to be actually there in the darkened
room, able to converse freely in their own voices, and often with other
characteristics of their earthly existence easily distinguishable.

These sittings or séances were entirely private, and I don’t have to
tell you that no admission fee was charged. But if any of those who
attended felt that their enjoyment had been of quite unusual dimensions
either in the way of witnessing absorbingly interesting phenomena or in
having departed friends or relatives actually speak to them, sometimes
even allowing shadowy glimpses of themselves like faint half-luminous
clouds to be seen shimmering about in the darkness, they were at
liberty to send to Mr. Sidney any little token of esteem that they felt
like offering.

Quiet and select little spiritistic gatherings like this were started
all over the country, when the extraordinary revival of interest in
such things came along carrying some very big names at the top of it.
And I want to tell you that there’s millions of dollars coming to the
people owning these names if a commission on the business they brought
in for the mediums could be collected.

At these private sittings, with Mr. Sidney in the chair, so to speak,
not only the friends and relatives of those present, but also quite a
number of distant acquaintances, or even just fellow townspeople, would
occasionally drop in; a few came at nearly every meeting for a bit of a
chat. It was almost as if they enjoyed talking things over with their
mundane fellow citizens—and for all I know they did.

One of these few who made an occasional spirit call, was a man well
known not only to everyone in that circle, but to nearly everybody in
the United States as well; he had been a renowned—you might almost
say world-famous—detective, a great part of whose life had been spent
in Chicago. A most entertaining talker he was, and seemed to enjoy
the opportunity of conversing with those he had left on earth when he
passed over, as the saying is.

At one of these private séances on an evening along about the time I’ve
just been speaking of, they’d been having visits from various dead ones
(dead in an earthly sense I mean) for upwards of an hour, when the
medium announced the approach of this well-known man, and in a moment
the trumpet was seized in a strong grasp and a visit with him of more
than usual interest followed. Some one in the circle alluded to the
Haworth case in Boston, which had become, by this time, owing to the
unusual occurrences connected with it, quite the talk wherever you went.

Then a man on the other side of the circle asked Mr. P. (which is
what we’ll call this spirit) if he’d be willing to say anything about
that singular affair. “Certainly singular,” he said, talking through
the trumpet, which made his voice loud and clear; “an’ I notice that
several people on this side have got excited about it.”

“But can’t you give us anything about the case yourself?” was the next
question. And I’ll tell you beforehand that his answer was in the
morning edition of every newspaper in the country, as well as Canada.
It was about like this as I got it from the papers.

“Well now,” Mr. P. objected at first, “I can’t say I like talking about
that. What would I do, butting in?”

But many in the circle now began begging him to give them just a
hint of what his opinion was—what he said to be treated as strictly
confidential.

“Well,” he finally said, “if you’ll just consider it a private matter
between ourselves an’ leave my name out of it, I’ll say this: While
I have every respect for those Boston boys, they’ve got it doped out
wrong. I didn’t see the thing done, but as soon as I heard about it I
went over there an’ took a look around. The trouble is they’ve got it
set in their minds the shots were fired from outside. Everything was
fixed to look that way, but, heavenly Jerusalem! that’s what’s the
matter with it—_it was fixed_! They’d ought to take a look at those
front window blinds no matter if the vines _are_ growing over ’em.
You can do a great deal with vines if you give your mind to it. Also
they’ll find a bullet struck one o’ the elms out in front. If they want
it they can get it about fifteen feet up. The feller was firing high,
whoever he was.”

That was all Mr. P. would say on the subject, except that you couldn’t
expect any sort of good work in these days with a pack of yelping
newspaper hounds worrying the life out of you and giving away anything
they could get hold of so the man you were after could act accordingly.
After a few anecdotes about how they kept things quiet in his day, on
the principle that when your man was working in the dark against you
you ought to be let alone to do the same by him, he said good night and
was gone. Instantly the meeting broke up, and everybody was buzzing
about. Two or three jumped into a car and made for the Loop District
to talk it over with a couple of managing editors they knew, and the
conclusion quickly reached was to transmit the message to the Boston
police and also let the Associated Press have it—this without making
use of Mr. P.’s name. The result was that it went out to the press as
a Mediumistic Message from a Celebrated Detective.

It’s hardly necessary to state that the reporters at headquarters
wanted to know this and that, and what you might call a press rush
was made for Torrington Road. But the police were already making an
investigation, and the newspaper men were kept out of the grounds until
it was finished.

       *       *       *       *       *

The outside blinds to the front window of the room on the left—which
were flat against the wall on each side—had the appearance of having
been undisturbed for years. Tangled Virginia creeper grew so densely
over them that they could hardly be found. Yet when it came to the work
of clearing these vines away it was discovered that hardly any effort
was required. The blinds had evidently been opened as wide as possible
and the vines hung over them.

When brought to view, these shutters told their gruesome tale. Two
smashing bullet holes far up near the top where no one standing on
the ground outside could have reached,—one splintering a slat of the
left-hand shutter, the other cutting a fairly clean hole through the
frame of the one on the right, and both giving unmistakable evidence of
having come through from the inside (of course when the shutters were
closed) submitted their silent evidence.

The murderer, whoever he was, had evidently failed to think of the
blinds until it was too late, and they were shattered by the bullets
that had killed Charles Haworth. Then, with no time to otherwise
dispose of them, the mass of vines had been torn away from the wall on
each side until the shutters could be opened back against it, and the
vines then pulled over them. All this was a trick to make it appear
that the shots were fired from outside the front window—or at any rate
to avoid anything that conflicted with that idea. Again that mysterious
framing for the conviction of Findlay.

In either event the shattered window blinds and one of the bullets
found embedded in the trunk of an elm tree a few feet away, plainly
indicated that Findlay could not have fired the shots, even though he
may have thought he did.

Added to this was the significant fact that the detectives had been
unable to find any trace of a bullet on the walls at the inner end of
the room, where they should have been if fired from outside the front
window. The District Attorney was obliged to enter a _nolle prosse_,
and that was the end of it.

Augustus Findlay was a free man.

       *       *       *       *       *

His Attorney, Mr. Archibald Forbes, was waiting for him in the
corridor, and with a muttered “Come along, quick!” hurried him out to a
taxi. The windows of this vehicle were covered with newspapers pasted
to the inside, and a man with a heavy and obtrusive jaw was seated
within.

When the door was opened and Augustus saw this man, he hesitated, but
Mr. Forbes shoved him aboard and got in after him. The instant the door
closed, the taxi dashed down the street. The three men were shaken and
tumbled about as they rattled on at what, to Findlay, appeared to be
breakneck speed. The papers pasted to the windows prevented his seeing
where they were going.

It was something like half an hour before the machine stopped.

“Be careful!” warned Mr. Forbes in a hoarse whisper. “We get out here
and you’ve got to keep between us! If they find out we’ve got you away,
they’ll nab you!”

“What is it—what are you——”

“Sh!” warned the lawyer, impressively.

The two men ran across the walk, Augustus between them, and as they did
so the door of the house before which the taxi had stopped was opened
from the inside, and they dashed madly up the steps and plunged in, the
door being instantly closed after them.

It was a vacant house and without furniture of any kind. Findlay was
taken to a dark room in the basement where coal had been kept. It
contained bins and piles of rubbish which could be sat upon in an
extremity.

“You going to do something to me?” Findlay managed finally to stammer
out.

“Shut your mouth!” from the man with the jaw.

“Now listen to me,” began Mr. Forbes in a low voice. “I got you off by
a fluke, but they’ll be on to it in an hour or two. Mr. Sugden here’s
a Department detective and he’ll get you by the police to-night and
put you on a train. Also he’s got a wad of money for you—subscribed by
friends. Now I’m done with you! I said I’d get you off and by God! I’ve
done it! But if they ever get you again you’re finished—remember that!”
Having said which Mr. Forbes went up stairs and left the house.

Augustus stood silent. After a time he roused himself and glanced
about. His eyes fell on Mr. Sugden and a pathetic look came into them.

“Say,” (his voice trembling) “you look like a decent sport—that might
help a feller out.”

“What the hell do ye want? Ain’t I get’n’ ye by the cops?”

“Yes—yes—but I——You see, it’s this way. I’m feeling pretty sick—an’ if
you could manage to get me a drink somewheres——”

“Listen here, Topsy!” Sugden spoke unfeelingly. “You’re going to
Canada—didn’t you know that? _Canada_, you fish bait, where you can
swim in it!”

Shortly after this the detective left, reappearing again about nine
o’clock with a few things that Findlay had left at the Charles Street
jail, and in addition a heavy winter overcoat which he made the
frightened wretch put on. Somewhere about a quarter to eleven o’clock
they cautiously left the house, got into a taxi that was waiting, and
were driven to the Trinity Place Station of the Boston and Albany.
Sugden took Augustus down to the platform for the west-bound trains,
and arriving there, shoved him to one side where they were in the
shadow.

“Listen here,” he growled in a low voice with warning in it. “You’re
goin’ to take the night train for St. Louis, due here in about one
minute. But ye don’t stay on that train—get me? There’ll be a bull
waitin’ fur ye at the Union Station out there if ye do. You’re goin’
to side-step at Albany—see? It’ll be five in the morning. Keep to the
shadows an’ slouch on to the Montreal train at seven. Ye change at
Rouses Point, an’ that helps throw ’em off. When ye hit Montreal, lay
low! Get a bunk at some joint. Monkey with that mug o’ yours. Raise a
crop o’ hay on it; an’ whatever ye do, don’t be seen with a paper from
the States in yer han’s or they’ll cop you. After about two weeks
climb on a steamer for England. You’ll find a fake passport in with the
railroad ticket in that pocket” (touching Findlay’s overcoat on the
right breast). “There’s another name on it. You ain’t Findlay any more.
There’s a wad o’ money sewed in the linin’. Lose yerself over there.
An’ if yer life is worth anything to ye don’t cross back to this side
again. There’ll be a big reward out for ye an’ there’s sharp guys here
that makes a hell of a livin’ keepin’ tabs on boobs like you. I’m one
of ’em. An’ if ever ye _do_ take a fancy to come back I hope I’ll be
the guy that puts the nippers on ye. There’s yer train!” (With an ugly
jerk of his head toward it). “Now on with ye, an’ I’ll keep back any
cops that’s followin’.”

Augustus hurried into the coach, and Sugden stood close to the steps
until the train moved on—which was in a few seconds, as the stop at
Trinity Place is brief in the extreme.

Of course you’ll realize that all this elaborate framing was for the
purpose of getting Findlay permanently out of the Western Hemisphere.
After the _nolle prosse_ there was nothing in the world they could hold
him for. Who it was that had got Mr. Forbes and Mr. Sugden to carry out
this scheme did not at the time, appear.

       *       *       *       *       *

Following at once on the collapse of the case against Augustus and his
discharge from custody, came the arrest of James Dreek, the butler, and
the holding of him for the murder.

In his avid eagerness for every detail that can be found (or
manufactured) in murder cases, the newspaper addict skips with perfect
ease from one suspect to another, often seemingly glad of the
change. In this instance, however, the very unusual interest had been
aroused, not so much by the hunt for the person or persons guilty of
the crime (though that feature was rapidly becoming absorbing) as by
the extraordinary manner in which the evidence in the case was being
brought to light. Everybody knew of that celebrated detective in
Chicago not long deceased, and his brief and characteristic comments
on the Haworth case through the mediumistic services of Mr. Harcourt
Sidney, and his calling attention to the shattered window blind and
the bullet in the tree, made not only a sensation, but a strange and
alluring one.

From the first intimation that somebody was framing Augustus
Findlay—which flashed upon them when Mr. Rathbun told of the fight for
the revolver under his window in Collamore Street—the detectives had
fastened their eyes on Dreek. There were already a few things that
didn’t look well for the young butler. They’d found a loaded revolver
under a lot of soiled linen on the floor of a cupboard in the butler’s
pantry. One or two letters they got out of his trunk had an ugly look.
Worst of all was the finding of his footprints on each side of the
front windows of the room on the left, these imprints overlapping those
of Augustus Findlay—thus showing that he’d been there after Findlay
had run away. These Dreek footprints had not meant so much before, as
Findlay was known to have been at the window when the shots were fired,
and therefore Dreek arrived afterward. But now that it was proved that
the firing was from within the house, it involved Dreek in several
ways, two of them being serious. Not only was he the only one in the
house with Haworth, according to all the evidence (excepting his
own), and therefore apparently the only one who could have fired from
the inside, but the footmarks showed unmistakably that he was the one
who went round after the murder and opened the shutters back against
the wall, replacing the vines over them in such a way that they would
give the appearance of not having been disturbed at all. He was now,
on account of this, definitely in the position of trying to throw the
guilt on an innocent man. This was corroborated by a number of small
items—the marks of a house stepladder outside under each shutter, the
finding of a house stepladder in the back entry which fitted into
these marks, and the fingerprint people reporting that Dreek had been
the last one who had handled it. He had insisted most emphatically in
his earlier testimony that he had gone out of the rear door several
minutes before the shooting and wasn’t in the house when it occurred.
But there was nothing to show that this was the case. On the contrary
there was every reason to suppose that he had not left the house with
the stepladder until after the shots were fired.

Of course he was in for a fearful ordeal. I’m not going to describe it
to you, but only give you my word that they third-degreed Jamie Dreek
good and plenty.

Precisely in the midst of these painful proceedings the Associated
Press again took a hand in the game—or to put it more accurately,
played a hand that had been dealt to it.

It was the day following the second night of Dreek’s torment. The
police had kept him awake for twenty-nine hours with their shouted
questions and punching-up process and rough handling. The job was
nearly done. He was “ripe” (put that in quotes) to sign anything or
confess anything. And then came the noon editions with big front page
headlines on top of A. P. dispatches from San Francisco.

It seems a well-known medium out there by the name of Waverley
Bentick was doing his turn—or whatever’s the right name for it—at
one of the specially high-class Spiritistic assemblies, held in a
large hall commonly alluded to as their “church,” and situated some
considerable way out Golden Gate Avenue. Mr. Bentick was passing out
messages to people in the auditorium, when, as he was in the midst of
a communication for a woman sitting in the second row, he suddenly
stopped and called out, “Wait a moment, please, and let this lady
finish!—Just a moment, I say!—You mustn’t break in like that!”

There was a pause. Then the medium resumed in an altered tone,
speaking to the assemblage: “I’m sorry, but a man has pushed in, in
spite of everything my control can do!—Tall—heavily built—grizzled
gray hair—pointed beard—looks as if he might be a doctor.... No—says
he isn’t one. Only keep us a moment—been trying to get through in
Boston—too many in the way. It’s about some murder case over there—the
Howard case, is that it?... No—that isn’t it! He doesn’t speak very
distinctly.... What?... All right, go on.... H-a-w-o-r-t-h. Oh, the
Haworth case! Yes, we’ve heard of that! I should think so!”

Instantly there was intense interest shown—people craning forward to
listen, and calls of, “Go on—go on!” For the extraordinary developments
in the case had by this time made it known everywhere,—especially among
those of the Spirit Sect—if that is a proper way to refer to them.

“He says he wants to speak of something now—while they’re
third-degreeing a man—as it may apply to him. Something about
money—yes—some money—large amount—paid to victim a few hours before
he was shot. Thirty-five thousand dollars.... Is that right?...
Yes—thirty-five thousand. Police haven’t been able to trace it....
If they want thirty-four thousand five hundred of it—old barn—old
barn.... Yes, we understand—old barn. What about it?... He says follow
butler’s footprints.... northwest corner in foundation wall under sill
timber.... Take out loose stone.... That’s all.... Good-by.”

In this case the Boston police got a rush wire from San Francisco that
gave them nearly a forty-five minutes’ start. Inside of twenty after it
came in, a Department automobile was speeding through Centre Street,
Jamaica Plain, and four minutes later was turning in at the old Cripps
gate from Torrington Road.

Perhaps you’ll have noticed that the attitude of the authorities toward
messages from the other world had undergone something of a change. Even
if the Inspector and others still entertained the notion that these
communications were founded on trickery of some kind, they were obliged
to admit that it was trickery with a hell of a kick to it, and that
made all the difference in the world.

It wasn’t exactly child’s play—nor even adult’s recreation—to trace
out James Dreek’s footmarks between the flag paving at the rear of the
house and the old barn farther back. But the old weed-grown drive up
which he’d gone was fairly soft, and they finally succeeded, arriving
at the northwest corner of the barn and finding the loose stone in the
foundation wall just under the sill timber. The thirty-four thousand
five hundred was in the cavity behind it.

This happened in the small hours. Close to four o’clock in the morning
it was—on account of the three-hour difference in time. The papers got
it for their afternoon editions. But the police treated it as an old
story. “Oh yes, we got the money some time ago!” “Yes, pretty good
guess from San Francisco, but a bit late!” “Of course it’s a bad thing
for Dreek!” That was about the gist of answers to the frantic inquiries
from the reporters at headquarters.

       *       *       *       *       *

That same morning about eleven o’clock James Dreek was nearing the
point of breakdown that the police were working him for. The gang that
took him on at noon (they worked in shifts) had it in for him. Even
then the pitiable wretch was trying to answer as best he could, but he
found it difficult to remember anything at all or even to understand
what his persecutors were talking about. Furthermore, his voice was
nearly gone, and his tongue so swollen and dry that he couldn’t speak
with any sort of distinctness.

“Ye say ye ran out o’ the house before the murder was committed—that’s
what ye say, is it? Answer! What’s the matter with ye! Answer the
question! Answer the question!”

Dreek tried to say “Yes,” but could hardly more than move his lips. It
must have been the eight hundred and sixty-eighth time they’d asked him
that.

“Now go on an’ tell us why ye run out? Why? Why? What was it started ye
out? Was ye sick? Whad did ye run out for?... Punch ’im up Lucas!...
Whad did ye run out for? Whad did ye run out for?”

“I—I thought——” His dry mouth and swollen tongue made it almost
impossible to form words.

“Go on—go on—go on! Whad did ye think?”

“Something terrible—going—happen!”

“_Goin’_ to happen! How in hell’s name could _you_ know something was
_goin’_ to happen unless you was goin’ to MAKE it happen! It _did_
happen, by God, an’ it was you made it happen—an’ then ye ran out o’
the house so’s you could FRAME SOMEBODY ELSE FOR IT!”

“No! No!” (With much difficulty and shaking his head.)

“What was it, then? What was it? What made ye run out?”

“Nos—noises!” His tongue seemed to get in his way.

“What kind o’ noises?... Punch ’im up Lucas!... What noises?”

“Noises—cellar—lights out—scared—ran for police.”

“Oh—police! Ye ran fur the police!”

Dreek nodded, and his bloodshot eyes rolled heavily from one to another
of his burly questioners.

“Did ye have to take a ladder with ye to find ’em?”

“Laddle—laddle—ladder?”

“Don’t try any funny business with us—we know what ye did! Now what
about that ladder, eh? WHAT ABOUT IT?”

“Oh—ladder—yes! Misser Ha’orth ass me open blin’s—front winnow. So
I—I—I was——” He broke off as his head fell forward in sleep.

“Punch him up Lucas! Keep ’im on the job, can’t ye!... Listen here,
Dreek—that ladder was to open the blinds, ye say. Now what did ye want
’em _open_ for—tell me that! TELL ME THAT!”

“Yes——” (with a great effort to keep awake). “Always Misser Ha’orth
like blin’s open—always!”

“Then what the hell was they SHUT for? What was they SHUT for?... Punch
’im up Lucas—put a dig in ’im!... Now answer the question! WHAT WAS
THEY SHUT FOR?”

Dreek struggled to remember, but finally shook his head.

“Now I will ask ye something. What about that money? Ye wouldn’t answer
lass night, but now we got it on ye! You saw that money! What?”

“I—I——”

“You saw it, I say! You saw that big pile o’ bills they had out on the
table? Why don’t ye answer? I’ll tell you why—YE’RE AFRAID TO TELL!”

“No” (shaking his head) “not afraid! I saw—yes.”

“What was ye do’n’ sneakin’ round spyin’ on ’em like that when they had
money in sight? Why didn’t ye stay in the kitchen where ye belong?”

“I—I don’ know——Oh—now—yes! They rang—they ass me—sign paper—witness!”

“A fine witness you was, all right, all right!”

Every detective in the room roared with laughter. The man who’d been
questioning turned suddenly on Dreek. “When did ye crib that money?” he
demanded.

“When did I——”

“You got it! Don’t ye s’pose we know you got it? Now _when_? _When?_
D’ye hear? WHEN DID YE CRIB THAT MONEY?”

The muscles of Dreek’s throat went through the spasmodic motions of
swallowing.

“I—promised not to——”

“Not to what? Whad did ye promise—eh?”

“Not to—say—anything——”

“Who did ye promise that to?”

“Miss’r Ha’orth.”

“How did that happen?”

“He handed—money—me.”

“Oh, _handed_ it to ye, did he? Made a little present o’ thirty-five
thousand to ye, I s’pose!”

Dreek tried to speak but couldn’t manage it.

“Whad did ye do with it?”

Again Dreek couldn’t get the words out—it would take so many to explain
it.

“I’ll tell ye what ye did with it—_ye put it in the barn behind a loose
stone_! D’ye deny that?”

“No.”

“Oh, ye _don’t_ deny it! _Ye did it!_ Ye stole that money from Charles
Haworth an’ then, by God! ye hid it in the wall o’ that barn! D’ye
confess you hid it there?”

“He ass me pu’ there—safe place!”

“So! Now ye got it out! Now, by God, we got yer story an’ a pretty one
it is! What ye’ve told us is jus’ the same as a confession ye shot the
man yerself! Yes, by God! ye jus’ as good as said it! Now, the way it
stan’s, yer one chance is to spit out the truth in plain words! The
truth is ye shot Haworth yerself—ye hid the money yerself—an’ ye went
out an’ opened the shutters yerself so people ’u’d think a man outside
done the shootin’! Put that in plain words an’ sign it an’ ye got some
chance! Ye got a chance o’ mercy from the court if ye confess ye did
that! W’at about it—eh?”

The “No” Dreek tried to say couldn’t be forced through his parched
mouth, so he shook his head.

“The story ye’ve told’ll put ye in the chair—give ye the grand
burn—see?—shock the guts out o’ ye! YE HEAR w’at I say?”

Dreek made no attempt to answer.

“They’ll find ye guilty in ten minutes! That story ye told is the end
o’ ye! THAT’S YOUR FINISH, BY GOD!”

Another persecutor started in on him—an enormous man with a rumbling,
bellowing voice: “Didn’t you open those shutters, Dreek? Didn’t you
open ’em back against the wall and put the vines over ’em? Didn’t you
take that ladder out there and do that thing? Aren’t you the one who
did it? Answer that! AREN’T YOU THE ONE?”

“Yes——” Dreek got out in a whisper and nodded his head a little.

“That convicts you! That convicts you!”

“You’re fur the chair!” another detective joined in. “You’re fur the
chair! You’re done fur now, by God!”

“That’s the end o’ you!” “You’re in for the dead house!”

They’d all come up with a rush and were standing close about him.
Painfully he turned his eyes from one to another as they spoke, all
joining in with violent exclamations as to his finish.

“There’s only one thing that’ll save you now!” roared the man with the
bellowing voice. “Only one thing to do now if you want mercy: sign a
confession an’ they’re bound to treat you fair! YOUR ONLY CHANCE ON
EARTH!” He snapped his fingers and a stenographer (plain-clothes man)
entered from the inner office and handed him a typewritten sheet. “Here
it is,” he went on. “He’s written it out—just what you told us—just
what you told us.”

“Wha—wha—what I——” (A weak whisper.)

“Just that. For Christ’s sake can’t you see we’re trying to get you off
the death sentence? It may be prison, but what’s that? A few years an’
then some damn Governor that wants women’s votes pardons you out! Here
it is—put your name there. See that line?”

Dreek was holding a pen clutched awkwardly in his hand, having no idea
where it came from. He managed to shake his head a little.

“Not—not if it says I killed—— ... no—no ... not that—not——”

“Here Lucas——” And all the detectives in the room turned as if to
leave. “Put the next watch on him. One more night of it’ll change his
mind!”

“No!—Oh no!” Dreek made hoarse and breathless noises, “O my God!—not
another—not another! O my God!”

The big detective swung round to him suddenly.

“Sign here—right under here—see?” pushing the paper under his eyes,
while another man seized the pen and dipped it in nearby ink. “Sign
here—on that line! IT’S THE ONLY THING THAT’LL SAVE YOU!”

Other detectives gathered close round, shouting to him to go on and
sign, and yelling threats in his ears of what would happen if he didn’t.

James Dreek, gasping and mumbling incoherently and with shaking hand,
made marks with the pen which were as near his written name as he could
manage.

The late editions that afternoon had a wealth of display headlines (the
Department had seen to it that the Associated Press got the news at the
earliest possible moment) which ran—in slightly varying forms to—this
effect:

 FULL CONFESSION IN THE HAWORTH CASE

 JAMES DREEK THE ASSASSIN

 THEFT THE MOTIVE

 STOLEN MONEY RECOVERED BY POLICE

 BRILLIANT WORK OF DETECTIVES

At last the Department had things coming its way—for which reason much
relief was felt.

       *       *       *       *       *

As James Dreek had made a confession and signed it, the tide of public
interest and curiosity began to ebb. There was no longer a mystery.
The young butler had done the deed. Robbery was the motive. He had got
hold of that thirty-five thousand dollars and hidden it. Some spirit in
California had told the police where to look for it. This in itself was
of course an odd occurrence, but the riddle of guessing who the guilty
man was and why he did the appalling deed no longer existed. This
being so, the bulk of the inhabitants of Boston and its environs began
looking eagerly in their daily papers for the next killing. As to the
sensation-guzzlers in other cities, they no longer had their attention
diverted from their enthralling local atrocities. The amazing behavior
of the spirits remained as something to be spoken of when the subject
of ghosts and haunted houses came up.

       *       *       *       *       *

As the date set for the Dreek trial approached, it appeared to those
who kept in touch with spiritistic affairs, that extreme restlessness
regarding the Haworth case was prevalent in higher spheres—if what came
through via various mediums could be taken as a truthful indication.

A wire from Providence, Rhode Island, stated that a private séance
in that town had been considerably upset by the insistent demands of
a disembodied soul claiming to be that of the father of young Dreek,
that something be done—and done damned quick—to rescue his son, who was
absolutely innocent, from the clutches of the blackguards and bullies
who posed in Boston as police, but who were simply low-lived thugs and
dirty bums. The press dispatch giving an account of the affair went on
to say that the language proceeding from his apparition had grown so
violent that two elderly ladies felt obliged to quit the room where
the séance was being held, although it must be conceded that they were
later seen to be listening just outside the door. It was really quite
thrilling while it lasted, this flow of expert profanity, and a few
knowing ones were aware that this spirit used expressions and dialect
prevalent among a certain class of crooks practising in what is known
as “The Gay Nineties.”

The Press paid little attention to the Providence message and the
police none whatever, owing to the fact that nothing was included
in it which substantiated its claims that Dreek was innocent. This
communication, though, was followed by a disembodied statement—if I
may put it that way—which reached the earth via a New Orleans trance
medium, to the effect that the fools in Boston had third-degreed an
innocent man to his death, adding that no surprise could be felt by
those who remembered how the police had recently treated the entire
populace of that unfortunate town.

Dubuque, Iowa, sent in something of the same kind, and others began to
crop up from places quite remote. All of which went far toward creating
the impression that the next world was considerably dissatisfied with
the proceedings of this one in the matter of the murder on Torrington
Road, and that the inhabitants thereof were not averse to letting their
feelings relating thereto become generally known.

The members of the private circle in Chicago (recently alluded to, and
since then greatly increased in numbers) wished beyond anything else
that Mr. P., the famous detective not long deceased, would return and
let them have his views upon matters as they now stood in the Roxbury
case. But it was their third meeting after the one at which he had
advised the examination of the window shutters and the extraction of
bullets from trees, before he dropped in again; and when he did come he
gave the impression of trying his utmost to avoid the subject. Finally,
upon being asked point-blank if he wouldn’t please let them know just
his personal opinion as to the guilt or innocence of James Dreek, the
reply came back through the trumpet that he thought it would be just
as well to go easy on that young man. Those were his final words.
When another question was put to him it was found that he had quietly
slipped away; not even those very near heard the trumpet fall when he
released it.

       *       *       *       *       *

In Boston there was displayed rather more of this spirit restlessness
than elsewhere, for a considerable number of mediums about the city and
its suburbs were getting communications from their controls protesting
Dreek’s innocence and begging that something be done about it.

More than any of the others were Mrs. Belden’s sittings (she was giving
“private circles” now with great success) pervaded by this sort of
thing, and it was the spirit of the hysterical Cynthia which created
most of the disturbance. She took possession of the medium at every
opportunity and was more often than not incoherent from excitement—or
whatever it may be that appears so often to afflict the souls of people
who have successfully emancipated themselves from the thralldom of
their bodies.

At several of Mrs. Belden’s séances (which were always held in
private houses), Cynthia had occupied much of the time and without
result—although owing to the great interest in the spiritistic features
of this case, none of the persons present made objections to the delay.
On the contrary, they all waited with eager interest, hoping that this
spirit, which was the one through whom the revelation as to Mr. Rathbun
and the fight for the revolver had come, would eventually disclose
something else of equally startling importance.

At these appearances of Cynthia—or more correctly at these times when
she got the floor, as you might say—she occupied much of the time in
mourning over the plight of poor Dreek and begging people to help in
his rescue. Then, toward the end, the sitters could make out that she
was desperately anxious to see somebody—a woman, it appeared, but so
far she’d been unable to get the name across. “Bring her here! Oh,
bring her! She’s the only one—the only one who knows! The only one! The
only one!” And so on.

On that, some one would ask the spirit for the name of the person she
wanted so much, and always the answer came back from Cynthia: “Oh,
I don’t know it! Not now—not now! It’s gone! I knew it before, but
they’ve taken it away from me! Don’t you know who I mean? Oh, you must
know! Can’t somebody tell?” And that sort of thing, trailing off into
moans and inarticulate sounds of pity. And soon after that she would
vacate the medium.

       *       *       *       *       *

Dreek’s trial had been going on four days before Cynthia’s spirit was
able to overcome whatever influence was holding her back—much as it had
been on a former occasion—and then the whole thing poured out on them
like a flood released.

Mrs. Amelia Temple was the woman she wanted. Mrs. Temple could save
him. Couldn’t they bring her at once? Oh, quickly! She wanted to talk
to her! When reminded by one of the circle that the old woman had, from
the beginning, refused to say anything, she said: “No matter—bring
her—bring her—bring her! Don’t waste time!” And went on that way till
she came near to hysterical shrieks. But even while she was carrying on
like that people had gone out to try and find the old woman.

It was late in the evening—something after eleven—when Mrs. Temple was
brought to the house. There had been no difficulty in persuading her
to come. It appeared that she had once had an experience. Quite far
back in her life she had lost her mother, the only one dear to her at
that time, and her loneliness and yearning had drawn her to spiritist
gatherings where, she had heard, departed ones are able to come back
and speak to those they have left behind. To her unspeakable joy she
found that this was so, and became, forthwith, an intense devotee.
But after about two ecstatically happy months of it her faith was
rudely shaken, for, at a séance where materializations were being
accomplished, she suddenly saw something that looked to her like
evidence of fraud. At the next of these séances she became satisfied
that there was fraud. It was a cruel blow to her. Many times she wished
she hadn’t found out. From that time she never attended another séance
or spiritist meeting of any kind.

That was long ago. And now, after reading the newspaper accounts of the
developments in the tragic affair which so deeply concerned her (she
read everything about it that she could find), the extraordinary spirit
communications that had been received in connection with it, all but
convinced her that, if there had been fraud in that long ago experience
of hers, it must have been only because of an untrustworthy medium and
did not in any way affect the system or belief itself. One had only
to see what marvels it was responsible for in this case, to be made
certain that the spirits of the dead are here with us and doing what
they can for our welfare.

And so, upon being told that the spirit of Cynthia Cripps Findlay
(she very well knew who was meant by that) was begging, through the
mediumship of Mrs. Henrietta Belden, that she come and let her speak to
her, she dressed immediately—for she’d gone to bed—and went with the
two women who’d come from the séance to fetch her.

The spirit of Cynthia began to talk the moment Mrs. Temple entered
the dimly lighted room, and continued while she was being silently
conducted to a chair near the medium.

“Oh, you’re here! Thank you so much for coming, Mrs. Temple! Oh,
I _do_ thank you! And you _will_ help us—you _will_! You couldn’t
refuse—you’re so tender-hearted to anyone in distress! And some one
_is_ in distress! Oh, some one _is_—terribly! It’s the poor Dreek boy,
the butler who was with Mr. Haworth, and he’s being tried for murder
at this very moment—and perfectly innocent as you know—as you know
_so well_, Mrs. Temple. Why, the poor fellow never raised a finger to
hurt anyone or steal anything—but there’s no way to save him unless you
will tell them what you saw—just what you saw—that’s all we ask! It’s
for his mother, his poor old mother, ill in New York! And, oh, listen
to me—your mother is here—she’s here with me because she wants so much
to help us, but she can’t speak to you herself—she’s one of those who
can’t get through. She tried it long ago, as you may remember. So she
asks me to tell you that she’s sure you’ll help us save this innocent
boy—for her sake if nothing else. And oh, will you please wait a
moment, Mrs. Temple?”

A short pause. Perfect stillness in the room. Then the spirit of
Cynthia spoke again.

“Your mother—I was speaking to her—oh, you can’t have any _conception_
of how dear she is—she’s just waiting till you come—and she wants me
to say that she loves you as always—it will never change—it couldn’t
change—oh, _it couldn’t_ Mrs. Temple! And she’s been with you almost
all the time—just staying near—that’s all she could do. And she’s so
happy that you’re still keeping the old bonnet she used to wear—she
sees it there in your trunk whenever she’s with you in the room—and
she knows you’ll think of this poor young man’s mother the same as she
does, and what a terrible thing it would be for her if her son—who
never did it—was found guilty of such a _fearful_, _awful_ crime. It
isn’t death (as you call it) that matters, but _such a death_! Oh,
Mrs. Temple, think what it would mean to his poor mother, and for her
sake and for your own mother’s sake, tell them what you saw—just tell
them—oh—tell them!—Oh!...” The voice of Cynthia, uttered through the
expert mediumship of Mrs. Belden, trailed rapidly away to nothing and
the spirit was gone.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mr. Forbes (for the defense) was unable to bring in Mrs. Temple’s
testimony as a surprise. Though the séance was a strictly private
one and held in a private residence and with no reporters admitted,
the Inspector had insisted on having a representative at any
“spirit circle” in which Mrs. Belden officiated; and although the
representative in this case—a plain-clothes man—had seen to it that
there were no listeners behind doors or otherwise concealed, and had
afterward instructed the medium and all those present not to give away
anything that had been said or done, and furthermore had had every
one of them shadowed by detectives both in the house and after they
left it, the papers next morning had full accounts of the appeal of
the disembodied spirit of Cynthia to the still-embodied spirit of Mrs.
Temple, and the court room was packed with an eager multitude, rabidly
craving excitement.

When her name was called, the crowd, as one person, held its breath,
and strained its eyes to see and its ears to hear.

The old woman was given a chair in the witness box, and the usual form
of preliminary questioning gone through. After that, she was led by Mr.
Forbes to describe how she’d been at one of the side windows of the
room where the murder was done, a short time before it took place, and
was trying to see in, but owing to its being pitch-dark inside, she
was unable to make out anything, though she heard strange and alarming
noises; how she then hurried to the rear of the house and tried to get
in there, but every door—even the basement—was locked, and she had to
give it up; and how, more alarmed than ever about Mr. Haworth, she
then started, as fast as she was able to go, toward the front of the
house again.

“When you were hastening in this way toward the front, Mrs. Temple, did
you pass near the window where you’d been trying to look in?”

“Yes sir; the path warn’t more’n a few yards from the side winders, but
it was mos’ly growed up with bushes an’ things in between.”

“Could a person among the bushes at one of the windows, see anyone
passing along that path?”

“Ef there was any light, they could.”

“What was your object in hurrying toward the front of the house again?”

“I wanted to git down to the road.”

“What did you intend to do there?”

“I was goin’ to find some one to help me—ef I could.”

“You mean the police?”

“Mercy no! They ain’t no earthly use!”

“I object!” shouted the District Attorney, springing to his feet.

“Just answer the question, madam.” (From the Court.)

“And I ask Your Honor that the remark of the witness be stricken from
the record.”

This request was granted, and Mr. Forbes went on.

“Where did you expect to find help, Mrs. Temple?”

“If I didn’t find nobody in the road, I was goin’ to try the house
on the fur side a ways up. There was some men there.” She put a very
slight accent on the word “men.”

“And _did_ you go down to the road?”

“No sir. I was stopped sudden-like by a bright light flashin’ up
inside the room as I was goin’ by. It was so bright it lit up the
chinks o’ the winders, an’ thinkin’ I could see then if anyone was
there an’ what they was doin’, I pushed through the bushes an’ went up
clost to one of ’em.”

“Which one did you go to?”

“Why, the first one I come to I seen the roller shade was pulled down,
so I went on to the next.”

“That would be the one nearest the front of the house?”

“Yes sir, that was the one.”

“And did you find that you could see anything inside?”

“I found the shade was down there, too, but it warn’t pulled quite to
the bottom so’s it left a narrer crack.”

“And could you see into the room through this narrow aperture below the
curtain?”

“Not at first I couldn’t—the light dazzled me some—but in a minute I
got used to it an’ then I could.”

“Tell the Court what you saw, Mrs. Temple.”

“Mr. Haworth—it was him I seen first. He was settin’ by the table,
readin’ a book. After a minute or two he felt in his pocket an’ got his
pipe out an’ filled it an’ was huntin’ around fur a match.”

“Was there anyone else in the room?”

“Not as I could see from the winder I was at. But just as he was
lookin’ fur the match I commenced to think mebbe there might be
somebody behind him in the back part o’ the room, so I hurried through
the bushes to the other winder—the one further back. I knew the shade
was down, but I thought mebbe there was a crack at the bottom same as
the other, an’ I found there was—on’y not so much, but by twistin’
around I could get a look through to the back part o’ the room, an’
there was a man standin’ there, back against the door o’ the butler’s
pantry, an’ he had a black thing in his hand that he was pointin’ at
Mr. Haworth from behind.”

A moment of tense stillness followed on this, as Mrs. Temple stopped
speaking. I don’t suppose there was one person among the spectators in
that packed court room who hadn’t stopped breathing.

After letting the pause have its full effect, Mr. Forbes spoke with all
the solemnity he could command.

“Mrs. Temple,” he said, “was the man you saw standing behind Mr.
Haworth and aiming a black object at him, the accused you now see on
trial in this court—James Dreek?”

The old woman shook her head. “No sir, it warn’t him,” she said.

“Are you sure of that?”

“Yes sir.”

“What makes you certain that it was not the accused?”

“For one thing, he warn’t built no ways like him—he was heavy-set an’
solid. This man” (pointing at Dreek) “ain’t that way.”

“You say his different size and build, _for one thing_. Was there
something else that made you still more positive that this was not the
man?”

“Yes sir.”

“Kindly describe it.”

“I was just turnin’ away from the winder to get to the other one an’
warn Mr. Haworth, when I seen this man you’re tryin’——”

“James Dreek?” interjected Mr. Forbes, to prevent any mistake as to the
person she meant.

“Yes sir, James Dreek—I seen him come hurryin’ along the walk carryin’
a ladder.”

“Which way was he going?”

“Toward the front o’ the house.”

“What did you do then?”

“I kep’ on as fast as I could to the other winder—the one near where
Mr. Haworth was—so’s I could call out an’ warn him. As soon as I got
there I begun screamin’ out his name an’ beatin’ on the winder glass,
but I hadn’t no more’n started doin’ that when there was a terrible
loud crash of a gun goin’ off, an’ right after it another, an’ Mr.
Haworth turnin’ round an’ tryin’ to ketch a holt o’ the table; but he
couldn’t do it, an’ there he was sinkin’ down on the floor—sinkin’ down
there right before my eyes!”

It was some time before the old woman could go on, but the Court
waited. Finally Mr. Forbes, seeing that she was getting control of
herself, went on with the examination.

“Tell us what you did then, Mrs. Temple.”

“I—I kinder sunk down there under the winder—as if all my stren’th was
took away. But in a minute I was able to git up again, an’ the first
thing I see was this Dreek man on the path there where I’d seen ’im
afore.”

“What was he doing?”

“He’d stopped where he was an’ let the ladder fall on the ground. But
just as I looked at him he picked it up again an’ set off runnin’.”

“In which direction did he run?”

“The same as ’e was goin’ afore—toward the front o’ the house.”

“And what did you then do, Mrs. Temple?”

“I run as fast as I could toward the back—the kitchen.”

“What was your idea in going there again?”

“Why I—I wanted to get to ’im as quick as I could.”

“To Mr. Haworth?”

The old woman nodded, unable, for a moment, to speak.

“What made you think you could get in? You’d tried it a few moments
before, hadn’t you?”

“Yes sir, but this Dreek man had come out sense then, an’ I didn’t
think he was liable to ’uv locked the door, carryin’ the ladder like he
was.”

“_Had_ he locked the door?”

“No sir, he hadn’t.”

“Which door was it?”

“The basement.”

“So you got in?”

“Yes sir.”

Mr. Forbes indicated that he was through with the witness, and the
district attorney took her, his manner conveying the impression that
he considered her testimony as almost too flimsy to waste time over.
He soon learned, however, that it wasn’t such an easy matter to punch
holes in it. As a sample, without going into it as a whole:—

“I believe you made the statement, Mrs. Temple, as other witnesses have
done, that the night when all this occurred was a dark one. Did you so
testify?”

“Yes sir.”

“Was there a moon?”

“I didn’t see none.”

“But you admit the night was unusually dark?”

“It was dark—I ain’t got no idea how unusual it was.”

“Very well—that’s all I want to know—it was dark. Now Mrs. Temple,
on this very dark night—the blackness being almost impenetrable, as
has been shown by the testimony of others, although you yourself, for
some reason, don’t seem inclined to admit it—in this dense and inky
blackness you claim to have recognized the accused going by on a path
at some distance from you. How do you explain that?”

“I s’pose you warn’t int’rested when I was speakin’ about them roller
shades to the two side winders not reachin’ down to the bottom so’st it
left a crack where the light could git through.”

“You mean to say enough light could pass through a little slit like
that to enable you to recognize a person on a pitch-dark night twenty
feet away?”

“Yes sir.”

“Do you expect me to believe that?”

“No sir.”

“Oh! You _don’t_ expect me to believe it!”

“I ain’t botherin’ one way or the other about what you believe. I’ve
got enough to think of besides that!”

“Well then, let’s get a little light on what _you_ believe, Mrs.
Temple! We have information that you attended a séance last night,
a private séance given by a medium named Henrietta E. Belden, and
that you are here giving evidence in this court because disembodied
spirits—in other words people who have passed away—requested you to do
so. Do you deny that this is the fact?”

“No sir, I don’t deny it.”

“Then am I to understand that you are a believer in the
supernatural—that spirits are about us, speaking to us through mediums,
and that these dead people can be relied on to give assistance and
advice in a case like this? Do you believe that, madam?”

“Well I ain’t certain sure of it, but I’m tendin’ that way, seein’ how
much more the dead ones seem to know about this case than you folks
that’s still walkin’ around.”

A roar of laughter swept over the crowded room, broken by the court
crier’s loud rapping for silence. It might have been observed that the
Court itself bowed its head over as if making notes, so that its face
was hidden for a moment.

And so it went on, every effort to undermine Mrs. Temple’s credibility
as a witness serving the more firmly to establish it. She could not be
confused nor rushed nor intimidated, though all three of these methods
were attempted. Over and above this it was very soon discovered that
she had no idea of going further with her testimony than giving what
related to the innocence of James Dreek. As to that, however, her
evidence was clear, straightforward, and unshakable.

The confession signed by Dreek when he was out of his mind from the
torture of sleeplessness and constant bullying had been riddled by the
Defense, and cut no figure at all, so that when the case went to the
Jury a verdict of “Not guilty” was returned within fifteen minutes
and Jamie Dreek caught the next train home to his old mother, whose
devastating anxiety about him had brought her to within a stone’s throw
of the grave.

       *       *       *       *       *

You mustn’t get the idea that the Dreek trial came to an end in the
brief time my way of telling about it would seem to indicate. I said
just now, that _when_ the case went to the Jury there was a verdict in
fifteen minutes; but that _when_ took quite some days. In fact there
was a most peculiar delay directly following Mrs. Temple’s testimony.

You’d naturally think that when the entire bottom had dropped out of
the thing they’d have got the Jury out on it as quick as they could.
But they didn’t, for the State was holding it up in every possible
way—recalling witnesses without reason—wrangling over this and that,
and playing for time whenever a chance came up. The Defense was brief
enough, and the Judge occupied only a few minutes in charging, but the
prosecution managed to string it along for four days, and of course
the wise ones began to make remarks about the District Attorney having
something up his sleeve. The singular part of it is that for once “the
wise ones” were right.

On the fifth morning following Mrs. Temple’s appearance on the witness
stand, the not guilty verdict was brought in, and that same afternoon
Hugo Pentecost was arrested for the murder.

It came to pass at headquarters. Pentecost had been sent for by Chief
Inspector McCurran to give further information, and had been answering
such questions as he could—which is to say, as he could with safety.
There were others in the room—a couple of detectives (plain-clothes
men), two or three policemen in uniform, and a stenographer
(plain-clothes).

“By the way,” the Inspector asked, carelessly, after a number of
commonplace questions had been answered, “did you ever happen to wear a
pair of boots that were very much too large for you?”

“Why yes,” (after just enough surprise to go with so odd a question);
“I suppose I have—at one time or another.”

“Ah—you have!... But your recollection doesn’t extend, I presume, to
your having worn such boots recently?”

“Pardon me,” Pentecost returned, “but is this flattering curiosity
as to my wearing apparel merely personal, or are you still seeking
information in the case of Haworth?”

The Inspector’s eyes glittered into Pentecost’s for a second or two.
When he spoke it was pointedly and with deliberation. “I’m still
seeking information in the case of Haworth.”

“That being so,” Pentecost responded in a soft, pleasant voice, “you’ll
excuse me for going no further in the direction indicated.”

The Inspector drew his mouth into a mechanical grin.

“I’m inclined to think, Pentecost, that you’ll find yourself going some
distance further in that direction.”

“It’s inspiring to meet a real optimist, Mr. McCurran—there are so few.”

“Where were you between ten and eleven on the night Charles Haworth was
shot to death?”

Mr. Pentecost appeared to be quite unaware that a question had been
asked.

“We’ve got to hold you Pentecost.” The Inspector made a slight motion,
and one of the patrolmen stepped forward and stood at Pentecost’s side.

“Want anything from the hotel—toilet articles—clothing—that sort of
thing?”

“Many thanks—they’re outside in a grip.”

“Ah!” the Inspector said, after an instant’s pause of surprise. “You
looked for it, did you?”

“Great God!—what _would_ I look for with a couple of your teasers
running circles around me since the day I first came in here!”

“Noticed it, did you?”

The Inspector pulled his lips back into what you might take for a
grin. “But don’t go trying to pass that across,” he added, “as the
reason you brought your grip. There’s a better one than that.”

“Sure there is,” said Pentecost.

“You know damned well the game’s up and we’ve got it on you.”

“I know damned well you _think_ you have.”

“Ah! And would you care to tell the reason I think so?”

“Why certainly ... Pittsburgh.”

There was what you might call an instantaneous pause. The mention of
the name of the smoke-draped city apparently struck fire somewhere
inside of Mr. McCurran.

“What do _you_ know about Pittsburgh?” he demanded in a lowered voice
with anger not entirely excluded from it.

“Sorry to upset you,” murmured Pentecost.

“What do _you_ know about Pittsburgh?” the Inspector repeated.

“Much the same as you,” answered Pentecost.

“Where were you between ten and eleven on the night that Charles
Michael Haworth was shot?”

There was no answer, and almost at once the Inspector went on, his
voice more menacing: “If you’re not the guilty man, tell me your reason
for trying to put over that fake alibi on us—yes, an’ a damned foolish
fake at that, when we had you cold in Roxbury the same night?... So?
Nothing to say about _that_, eh?”

There was a moment of silence, during which the Inspector managed
to subdue any evidences of the fury which the name of the western
Pennsylvania city had aroused. Soon he resumed in a voice cold and
hard: “We find it to be a rule that a man who is unjustly charged with
crime is more than anxious to answer questions and explain his true
position. I observe that you have no such desire.”

“Accept my congratulations, Inspector, on having at last discovered the
missing exception to your rule.”

“Then you have no explanation to make of that manufactured alibi?”

“None—until the necessity arises.”

“Am I to understand that it hasn’t yet arisen?”

“Such an understanding would be according to fact.”

“In that case we may be able to assist it to do so.” And the Inspector
rose and walked away to another part of the room, motioning, as he did
so, to have Pentecost taken away.

The patrolman got the usual safety grip on Pentecost’s twisted coat
sleeves near the wrists, and took him out at a side door, one of the
plain-clothes men slipping out after him, and shortly thereafter he was
safely within the portals of the Charles Street jail.

       *       *       *       *       *

Inspector McCurran stood at a window revolving a few things in his
mind—and their revolution failed to please him. This was not from any
doubt of their case against Pentecost, for anyone could see they had
the murder buckled to him in every conceivable way—including one that
hadn’t been put down by the Inspector as conceivable up to this time.
But back of the whole thing was some cursed mystery—every now and then
they turned up evidence of it. Could there be, after all, anything in
the spirit business? Seemed absurd, but, by God! they had some pretty
good names to it!—Not in this country—but look at those big ducks in
England who were pushing the game!

And there was the man himself—Pentecost—something about him that made
one feel a shiver of apprehension. You’d put him down as slippery in
some peculiar, slimy sort of way, that would make any grip you could
get on him not worth a tinker’s dam.

The Inspector’s mind came round to Pentecost’s careless reference to
the city of Pittsburgh. It had nearly lost him his self-control—an
unusual happening with Matt McCurran. For this simple geographical
allusion meant that the knowledge of certain spiritistic phenomena
which had occurred in that town a few nights before, and which the
authorities supposed to be successfully suppressed, was now—or soon
would be—public property. If this man Pentecost had knowledge of these
occurrences, others had as well, and without doubt the papers would get
hold of it and there’d be the very devil to pay.

And you may as well know at once that the papers of the following day
_did_ get hold of it, and there _was_ the devil to pay—and he was paid,
too! Throughout the length, breadth, and thickness of the country, and
including as well our friend and near relation across the St. Lawrence,
the press dispatches did the Boston Police Department proud in one
place, and then, without knowing it, jabbed a knife through it in
another.

In every paper the first thing striking the reader’s eye was a
sensational write-up of the arrest of Hugo Pentecost as the murderer,
in the strange and mysterious Haworth case, and the astonishing
detective work accomplished by the Police Department in tracing the
(alleged) guilty man by a pair of old boots left in a cabin of a
Metropolitan Line steamer, and in puncturing one of the most ingenious
fake alibis on record. The dispatches went on to say that Mr. Henry
Harker and his son Alfred, of the firm of Harker & Pentecost, had both
waived extradition and were on their way to Boston with detectives,
and upon arrival would be held as accomplices. The stenographer of the
firm, Miss Dugas, who was wanted as a witness, and who might also be
implicated in the crime, was voluntarily accompanying the Harkers.

The foregoing, written up fully and triumphantly, was agreeable reading
for those connected with the Department; but in the same editions,
and nearly always in an adjoining column, was an A. P. dispatch from
Pittsburgh which simply tore the insides out of the first one.

It was headed, in every case, with these disastrous lines—or something
similar—and in type that came out and smashed a reader right between
the eyes:—

 SPIRITS SPEAK AGAIN IN HAWORTH CASE

 ADVISE MICROSCOPE IN PENTECOST ALIBI

 ASTOUNDING CLUES GIVEN

 OPERATOR’S LICENSE 2026

 BOOTS LEFT ON “NORTH LAND”

Then it got down to plain reading matter, and described a message
that had come through at a séance held in Allegheny—now a section
of Pittsburgh and popularly referred to as the North Side—five days
before, and instantly telephoned to the Boston chief of police, but
which, for reasons stated below, had only now been given to the press.
The spirit who got “control” of the medium conducting this séance
declined to give his name—in fact allowed that he had too many, his
life while on earth having been not precisely what it should have been.
He merely saw a chance to get even with a cocky screw who’d once—before
he (the spirit speaking) had crossed to the higher realms—put the
low-down play on him good and plenty; and the only thing he asked was
that some one present at the sitting would send word to the Boston
police to go after a big pair of boots that was left in a cabin of the
steamer _North Land_ on arrival in New York the next morning after the
murder; also he’d suggest that they put a microscope on a few other
little items of that beautiful alibi. For instance, it wouldn’t do a
damn bit of harm to dig up Operator’s License 2026. “Tell the bulls,”
he gave out in conclusion, “to take it from me they’ll pull something
out of the fire if they go after it!” And with that he was gone.

The A. P. dispatch on this Pittsburgh occurrence closed with a
paragraph in brackets explaining the five days’ delay in getting the
news. It stated that the spirit message had been telephoned to the
Boston police even while the séance was still in progress with the
medium under other controls. The Boston Department, for diplomatic
reasons, had withheld the news of this message from the Pemberton
Street reporters and had also asked the Pittsburgh police to hush the
matter up until the clues (if there was anything to it) could be worked
out and a clean-up of the guilty parties made before they got warning.
Pittsburgh headquarters found that only eleven persons had been present
at the séance, and got them all, together with the medium and her
assistant or director, before they left the place. These people,
appreciating the importance of keeping it quiet in order to bring the
criminals to justice, agreed to say nothing of the affair, and for five
days no leakage occurred. Then from somewhere (it could not be traced
to any of those concerned in the séance) a full account of the whole
proceeding had suddenly reached the Associated Press, and of course
could no longer be withheld from the public.

“The account of this amazing occurrence in Pittsburgh,” as one of the
Boston papers put it in a bracketed “Ed.” note following the A. P.
dispatch, “which is quite in keeping with former developments in the
Haworth case, can now be published without disturbing the activities
of the police, the ‘clean-up’ referred to having been successfully
accomplished, as may be noted elsewhere in this issue.”

This Allegheny episode might not have been so bad served up by itself,
but coming immediately under or on parallels with the triumphant
write-up of the Department’s detective work, showed that the whole
thing was done on a tip from the spirit world. You mustn’t understand
me as saying—or even intimating—that there wasn’t any good work done by
the police detectives. The trouble was that when they got anywhere they
were stood on their heads and everything they’d worked up dumped into
the discard by one of those ghostly manifestations or whatever they
might be.

Anyway, it isn’t an account of marvelous detective work I’m trying to
give you, but something which, as I look at it, is vastly more unusual.
The papers will give you stuff about “sleuths”—as they call ’em—every
day in the week, including Sundays; and if you want to go into the
field of fiction you’ll find there’s one born there every minute. But
so far as my experience goes, this was the first time people in the
next world ever took a hand in the game.

       *       *       *       *       *

The public interest in the Pentecost trial came near to being the
record for this class of diversion. You’d have thought the feeling
against him would have been so bitter that they’d have had to fight off
the lynchers. But it’s just as well to go easy on predicting how the
public is going to behave. Something about the man—it wasn’t beauty or
youth or romance—more like hypnotism, perhaps—in conjunction with his
ingenious methods of work so far as they had been made known, and also
his silence under fire (My God! how the public adores a man who keeps
his mouth shut!) got the people with him, notwithstanding the brutal
murder that they could now so plainly see was his doing. Much of the
sympathy may have resulted from the hopelessness of his case, for they
certainly had it all over him. He hadn’t said a word since his arrest,
excepting to state mildly—and even then, only when he was asked about
it—that he wasn’t guilty. And he sat in the cage quiet and unassuming,
never once dropping to the “cheerful act” nor the “bravado act” nor any
act whatever, but only sitting there quietly and hearing witness after
witness testify to things that were like so many nails in his coffin.

He saw his marvelously laid-out defensive system crumble and melt away
before his eyes; his carefully constructed alibi split into a thousand
pieces.

They had the chauffeur (Operator’s License 2026) who took him—dripping
with water—at about nine o’clock on the night of the murder, from a
place near the Soldier’s Monument just north of the Bourne Highway
Bridge over the Cape Cod Canal, and who left him, shortly before
half-past ten, at the corner of Centre and Greenough Streets, Jamaica
Plain. Even the fact of his having walked in a direction away from
Torrington Road when he left the car told against him. Of course he
did—that’s precisely what a man with criminal intent would do.

The Captain, Purser, and other officers of the _North Land_ were called
and testified against him—at least negatively—although they had, up
to this time, been the most important bulwarks of the alibi;—Captain
Snow now recalling the fact that he hadn’t seen the face of the man
on the forward deck whom he took to be Mr. Pentecost, after his ship
passed out of the canal, but only his back; and the other officers
realizing, when they came to think of it, that they hadn’t seen him on
board after the steamer emerged into Buzzards Bay—that is, until he was
disembarking at New York the following morning.

The conductor of the midnight express to New York, and the head end
trainman who’d had such difficulty in arousing him from apparent sleep
in the morning and getting him off at the Grand Central, were put on
the stand and told of his being on their train the night of the murder;
men from the New York Central’s railroad pier next south of the _North
Land’s_ berth, testified to having seen the rowboat come up under
the steamer’s stern as she docked in New York the morning after the
shooting, and put a man aboard her by a rope ladder; a man and his wife
from Buzzards Bay village, who’d been waiting on the highway bridge
over the canal for the “draw” to close at the time the _North Land_
passed through, on the night of the crime, testified to seeing a man in
the semidarkness come up from the low flats at the west of the bridge
approach, and climb into a car near the Soldier’s Monument, though
they couldn’t swear, owing to the darkness, to its being the accused;
these things, and scores of others not less important, put Pentecost
in the position of having faked an alibi by boarding the steamer in
Boston, going overboard from her during her passage through the canal,
returning thence to Roxbury by hired automobile, proceeding to the
rear of the Cripps mansion a few minutes before the shots were fired,
and within half an hour after the murder, staggering, disguised as a
drunken laborer, into the North Station, and there taking the 11:50
express for New York, finally getting aboard the steamer again from a
rowboat the moment she tied up to her dock.

Although no witness to his actually entering the house or to his being
in it at the time the deed was done, could be found, there was surely
sufficient evidence to convict him without it. At the same time the
District Attorney would have given a great deal to be able to cover
those points.

Pentecost’s senior counsel, Harvey Brookfield, had little to offer in
rebuttal, but he was a crack shot when the witnesses were turned over
to him, and many of them were raked raw by the cross fire. His request
that the head end trainman explain his remembering, for such a long
time, what kind of boots a stranger on his train had worn, brought
the reply: “Because every time I went through the car I had to shove
’em off the seat in front of him—they was muddy an’ I didn’t want him
fouling up the seat.”

“Very thoughtful of you, too! But you testified a few minutes ago, that
this man whose boots you noticed, was seated at the extreme forward end
of the car. Didn’t you say that?”

“Why, I said—I—I——”

“Certainly you did! I can have the stenographer read it to you if
you’ve forgotten.—Now I ask you to explain to the Court and the Jury
how this man—if he was, as you stated that he was, sitting at the
extreme forward end of the car, could put his feet on the seat in front
of him? How could there _be_ a seat in front of him if he was in the
very first seat? Now just tell us that—in your own language.”

“Well, he—he was up there at that end—it might ’a’ been one seat more
or less from the end—I didn’t notice. He was——”

“_Ah_—you didn’t notice!” broke in Brookfield, springing on him like
a cat. “That explains it! You didn’t notice! You told us that he was
at the extreme end, but you didn’t notice. Now you tell us about his
boots—perhaps you didn’t notice in that case, either! A man’s life may
depend on it—but you didn’t notice! You’ve rendered your testimony
before this court ridiculous by making a man put his feet on a seat
that wasn’t there!” And so on. But while this sort of thing might
tear a witness to pieces, it couldn’t, to any extent, weaken the
prosecution’s case.

In discussing the situation with Mr. Pentecost at the Charles Street
jail after one of the worst days in court, Mr. Brookfield declared that
there was nothing for it but to fall back on insanity as a plea. But
Pentecost wouldn’t hear of it.

“What’s the idea, then? I don’t need to tell you they’re piling it up
on us pretty thick.”

“They haven’t got me in the house yet. Keep jabbing on that till you
draw blood.”

“It won’t acquit you!”

“No matter—go to it.”

And Brookfield went to it.

It may surprise you to hear of an Attorney taking orders as to the
conduct of a case from his client—especially when said client was
so evidently a criminal of the most desperate character. But the
explanation is simple in the extreme. Pentecost owned Brookfield
through having bought and paid for him, and was virtually conducting
the case himself.

       *       *       *       *       *

While the Pentecost trial, owing to its extraordinary developments, had
held the interest of the country at large and kept the eastern section
of Massachusetts in something like a ferment of astonishment and
curiosity, it was toward the latter part of it that things really began
to happen.

When the testimony was all in and Mr. Brookfield was about to go on
with his summing up, a message was brought into the court room and
handed to the District Attorney. After a glance at it he was instantly
on his feet, asking to be allowed to bring in another witness whose
presence in court had hitherto been impossible, and whose testimony was
of the utmost importance in its bearing on the case.

Brookfield, of course, objected, but was overruled, and an old woman,
bent and rheumatic, was brought into the court room and assisted
between the rows of spectators, past the jurors, and into the witness
box. As she turned and faced the onlookers, and it was seen that Mrs.
Temple had consented to take the stand for the prosecution, a composite
sound of gasps, subdued exclamations, and quick whisperings issued from
the audience. Many had seen her when she testified in the trial of
James Dreek, and there was hardly one who hadn’t read in the newspapers
that the old woman knew everything about the murder—had, indeed,
actually witnessed it—yet couldn’t be persuaded to say a word excepting
to testify to as much as would clear the young butler of guilt. That
was for the Defense in the case of James Dreek—now the Prosecution in
the case of Pentecost, had her!

After the first surprise, all eyes shifted across to the prisoner’s
cage to see what effect this fearful menace—for that’s what it was—had
on Hugo Pentecost. But so far as could be seen it hadn’t any. The man
was sitting precisely as before, expressionless, waiting.

While Mrs. Temple was being sworn and the formal questioning gone
through, a Court Messenger entered, and threading his way between the
tables, handed a written communication to Chief Inspector McCurran,
who was seated at the Attorneys’ table, and who arose at once and left
the court room, followed by the messenger. Few noticed this, for the
attention of the spectators appeared to be divided between the old
woman on the witness stand and the accused in the prisoners’ cage,
whose death sentence—or what amounted to that—the former was surely
about to pronounce.

When the preliminaries were finished, District Attorney McVeigh in—for
him—an incredibly soft voice and gentle manner, led the old woman to
describe Mr. Pentecost’s behavior while on his several visits to the
Cripps mansion before the commission of the crime,—her suspicions
regarding his intentions; the attempts she made to warn Mr. Haworth
of the danger of dealing with such a man; and following that, her
exclusion from the house—and thereafter her efforts to keep watch from
the outside. From this she was tactfully brought to the events of
that last evening,—the closing of the blinds to the front window; the
coming home of Mr. Haworth followed by Augustus Findlay; her attempts
to see in at the side windows but the darkness within preventing;
her unsuccessful efforts to enter the house at the rear, and then
the sudden brilliant light in the room so that she was able to look
in through the narrow slits below the roller shades; her seeing Mr.
Haworth reading at the table and then filling and lighting his pipe;
her hurrying to the other window and seeing a man at the back of the
room whose face was covered (except for the eyes) with a cloth or
bandage and whose clothing was wet and draggled, pointing some dark
object at Mr. Haworth from behind; her turning to run back to the
window which was nearer to Mr. Haworth so that she could warn him, and
as she did so seeing James Dreek going along the path with a ladder;
her attempt to call out to Mr. Haworth; then the shots and his collapse
to the floor, and she herself so overcome that she sank down beside the
window; her recovering and trying again to get into the house at the
rear, and finally succeeding in doing so.

“How did you get in, Mrs. Temple?” the District Attorney asked.

“Through the basement door.”

“But wasn’t that door locked when you tried it before?”

“Yes—but it warn’t locked this time.”

“How long do you suppose this was after you heard the shots and saw Mr.
Haworth sink to the floor?”

“It must a’ been some few minutes, fur I wasn’t able to git up very
quick from where I’d sunk down.”

“And when you got into the house what did you do?”

“I hurried to him as quick as I could.”

“Do you mean Mr. Haworth?”

There was a pause before she spoke. “Yes,” she said in a lower voice,
with eyes seeking the floor. “You might ’a’ known that, I should think.”

“I did know it Mrs. Temple, but it’s important to have others know
it too. Now tell me this—if you can: did it take you long to get to
him—after you succeeded in entering the house I mean? The time is
important. Very likely you were detained by the house being dark?”

“No, I was used to it.”

“It was very dark, was it?”

“There warn’t no light at all—somebody must ’a’ shut it off while I was
hurryin’ back to get in. But I got to the stairs easy enough and up
into the kitchen; an’ then groped along through the butler’s pantry an’
opened the door of the front room where—where he was.”

“I see. And when you opened that door, Mrs. Temple, could you see
anything in the room?”

“Yes, I could.”

“But I understood you to say that the house was entirely dark?”

“It was. But when I pushed open the swingin’ door o’ that room there
was a faint light shinin’ on Mr. Haworth’s face as he lay there on the
floor, an’ I could see from its not stayin’ still that somebody must
be holdin’ it. Then I could make out the figger of a man—the one that
had the light in his hand—an’ he was bendin’ over lookin’ at the body,
an’ he hadn’t taken no notice o’ my comin’ in. At first I didn’t know
anything at all, but the minute I come to my senses I started to run
an’ git a holt of him; but just then the light he had in his hand must
’a’ slipped some way so’st the beam of it struck right across his face,
an’ he didn’t have no cloth tied around it that time, so I could see
who it was.”

The quiet in the room was intense. Every person there might have been a
wax figure.

“Mrs. Temple, who was that man?”

“It was him there—the one you’re tryin’.”

“Can you give the Court his name?”

“The one he went by was Pentecost.”

“Was there light enough to see him distinctly?”

“There was plenty for me.”

“Did you have any other means of identification?”

“What sir?”

“Was there anything else you’d know him by—hair, clothes, shoes, hands,
teeth—anything at all?”

“Oh!—Well, you see the second after the light struck across his face
it went out an’ I couldn’t see nothin’ at all. But I heered his voice
plain enough if that’s any good to ye.”

“It certainly is, Mrs. Temple. What was he saying?”

“He was shoutin’ out not to touch anythin’—that everythin’ had got to
be left like it was in the name o’ the law, or somethin’ like that.”

“And the voice you heard shouting those things—did you recognize it?”

“Yes sir.”

“Whose voice was it?”

“His—that man there.” (With a motion toward Pentecost.)

“Do you mean the accused—in the prisoners’ cage?”

“That’s who I mean.”

“Had you heard his voice before?”

“Yes—I had.”

“When?”

“He’d spoke to me a number o’ times, an’ then I heered him a-talkin’ to
Mr. Haworth quite frequent.”

“What did you do then, Mrs. Temple?”

“I run toward where I’d seen him an’ felt all around there—but
he’d gone. An’ then—I—I don’t know.... I must ’a’ sunk down there
where—where he was.”

“You mean Mr. Haworth?”

She nodded her head a little, as it slowly bowed down, hiding her face
from view.

Mr. McVeigh waited a moment so that the Jury might get the full effect
of the old woman’s grief, and then indicated to Mr. Brookfield that he
could take the witness.

But it so happened that Mr. Brookfield had caught a signal from
Pentecost, as previously arranged.

“I don’t care to examine, Your Honor,” he said.

       *       *       *       *       *

Shortly after this, Mr. Brookfield was seen to be addressing the Court,
but in so low a tone that few were able to hear him. For this reason a
sensation was created when the prison guards took Pentecost from the
cage and conducted him to the witness stand.

After the preliminaries there was a pause—whether intentionally so or
not, a most dramatic one. Brookfield on his feet ready to question,
yet stopping silent before the accused. Pentecost standing motionless
as marble in the witness box—the court officer at his side. Reporters
at the press table, pencils poised, eyes fixed on Pentecost’s face,
ready to catch and record his slightest change of expression. Every man
on the Jury regarding him with strained attention. The Judge himself
unusually interested. Stillness of death in the court room.

Brookfield began in a low voice, speaking slowly and distinctly.

“Mr. Pentecost, you have heard the testimony given before this Court by
Mrs. Amelia Temple?”

“Yes.”

“Have you anything to say regarding it?”

“Yes.” (A pause.) “It’s the truth.”

“All of it?”

“All that concerns me.”

“What can you say as to the rest of the testimony submitted before this
Court?”

“The same.”

“By that do you mean that all of it is true as to fact?”

“I do.”

“Now as to this testimony that has been given here, and which you
have stated is the truth—can you say that the inferences which would
naturally be drawn from it are the correct ones?”

“I cannot.”

“Why?”

“Because they make it appear that I have committed a murder.”

“How does it happen, if they are statements of fact, that they are
misleading as to such a conclusion?”

“They describe only a part of my movements and behavior, omitting what
would lead to the correct conclusion.”

“Do you claim that these omissions were purposely made?”

Mr. Pentecost shook his head slightly.

“The witnesses,” he said in a low voice, “were doubtless unaware of
them.”

“Will you—if it pleases the Court—make a brief statement outlining
these omitted facts.”

Mr. Pentecost waited a moment, and then, as the Court made no objection
thereto, began to speak in a subdued voice, faintly suggestive of
hopelessness.

“I have no witnesses,” he said, “except those who have testified
against me. But there are circumstances bearing on my actions which
none of these witnesses could have known; and while their consideration
by this Court is most vital to me, I have only my unsupported word
to offer, and feel that such consideration will almost certainly be
denied me. So I will refer to these things as briefly as possible and
with little hope. Let me speak first of my getting off the steamer at
Buzzards Bay, as that seems the most misleading thing against me. It is
true I did this, but not for the purpose of committing the crime with
which I am charged. Such an inference, indeed, is quite the reverse of
the correct one, for I came back to Boston that night hoping to save
Mr. Haworth from some calamity that I feared was about to overtake
him—and which, in fact, did so before I could prevent it.

“My association with the young man during the time I was negotiating
the purchase of one of his inventions, had awakened in me a most
unusual interest. His quiet and almost childlike sincerity, his
trustfulness and simplicity, appealed to me in a way that I cannot
describe. I am alone, with no family of—of any kind, and the experience
of suddenly being deeply interested in a person was something new to
me.

“The last day of the negotiations—which was at the end of a
fourteen-day option he’d given us—everything was concluded and we paid
over to Mr. Haworth a large sum of money. It was in bills—for he’d
asked to have it that way. As we were making this payment it suddenly
occurred to me that this trustful and helpless young fellow might get
into trouble with it, for in these days there are crackerjacks looking
for money who can smell it in a house, just passing by in the street.
It was a lonely place where he lived and didn’t look good to me, so I
cautioned him about it. But he smiled at me—one of his rare smiles that
seemed to sink right into you—and said he knew a safe place for it; and
anyway he’d have it there only till the next day.

“The three of us—my partner, his son, and myself—took the steamer for
New York that same afternoon, and I tried to get my anxiety about
the young man off my mind. But instead of going off it increased,
and by the time we were well out in the Bay it was like one of these
premonitions you read about. I did everything to rid myself of this
feeling—talked with the officers, ordered dinner, walked in the wind on
the top deck—but it was no use, and by seven o’clock I realized that
something had to be done.

“The steamer was due at the canal in about an hour, and I remembered
they had to slow down to half speed or less for the passage through. So
I got young Harker to make inquiries in a sort of casual way, as if it
was only from curiosity on his part, as to whether they’d stop at some
place along the canal if a person wanted to get off. If they said no,
I told him to throw out feelers to see if money would do it. But there
was no use—the thing was impossible.

“By this time I was in a—a most trying nervous condition. Suddenly
I realized that, without even thinking about it, I’d made up my mind
to jump off the steamer while she was in the canal and in some way
get back to Roxbury. I did this as the boat was passing the village
of Buzzards Bay. It was quite dark at the time, and I waited till the
steamer had passed through the Bourne Highway Bridge, as I knew the
passengers would be watching the great draw come down into place, and
even if the lights along the canal hit me, no one would be looking.

“After I got out of the swirl a few strokes brought me to shore. It
was a sort of low flat along there, and I got across it and up on to
the road embankment that is the north approach to the bridge. There
wasn’t any garage in sight and in a sort of desperation I stopped a car
coming up toward the bridge and asked where the nearest one was. The
man inside asked me what was wrong, for I was soaking wet, and I told
him it was a matter of life and death for me to get to Boston. He said
he’d just come down from there and was only a quarter of a mile from
his destination, so I could take the car he had (it was a hired one) if
the chauffeur wanted to do it, and he’d go on foot the rest of the way.
I suppose my dripping clothes made an impression. I fixed the chauffeur
all right with a couple of watersoaked ten-dollar bills, telling him
I’d double it if he did the trip under eighty minutes. And I want to
say that everything this man has testified to is the truth, for he
couldn’t possibly have known who I was, how I got to Buzzards Bay, or
where I was going in Boston. I’d be sorry indeed to get this innocent
man into trouble.

“My reason for leaving the car at some distance from the house on
Torrington Road was not because I planned to commit a murder—as
the Prosecution would have it translated, but only that I wanted to
approach the place with the utmost caution. Robbers or safe smashers
would have their lookouts posted, and it was up to me to get at the
inside operators before they had warning.

“I crawled in at the gate and worked along behind shrubbery. But I
hadn’t got halfway to the house when I made out the dim forms of two
men moving about. This was a tremendous relief, for I took them for the
lookouts, and their being there showed I was in time: if the job was
done they’d be gone. So I slid in among the bushes and crawled around
to the rear of the house.

“The two doors at the back were locked, but I happened to think of the
basement door, and on trying, found it was open.

“Luckily for me, my pocket flashlight still worked, and with it I was
able to run through the dark basement and up the stairs, across the
kitchen (which was also dark) and through the butler’s pantry. I bunted
open the swing door and ran into the long room where we’d been sitting
that same afternoon, but for a moment couldn’t see anything at all,
there was such a strong light on. It dazzled me, and I suppose I must
have stood with my electric torch pointing toward Mr. Haworth, as the
last witness testified. I really have no idea which way it was pointing
as I stood there blinded by the glare and trying to see. In a moment I
made out Mr. Haworth standing near the table in the middle of the room
lighting his pipe, and instantly started toward him, calling out his
name. But just as I did so two gunshots blazed out from somewhere quite
near—though I couldn’t say exactly where—and the poor fellow went down.
I got to him just as the lights went out, but as my pocket light was
still on I was able to see him, and I found he was dead.

“While I was there on the floor by his side I heard a sound from the
butler’s pantry, and instantly got to my feet. My light was still
on, but I switched it off after some little difficulty with it, and
shouting out that nobody must touch anything—for I had the feeling
there were people about and I knew the police would want everything
left as it was—I hurried out of the house by the way I’d come in. As
I got out into the air it began to dawn on me what trouble I’d be in
if anyone saw me there and they couldn’t find the man who’d committed
the crime. My only safety lay in getting out of Boston without being
recognized, for if my presence there was known it would lead to their
finding out that I’d jumped off the steamer, and that would put me in a
terrible position—always supposing they couldn’t find the guilty man.

“I got around into Boston by way of Brookline, and in a poorly lighted
side street I ran across a tough-looking bum wearing old and grimy
clothing and carrying a considerable load of alcohol. I struck a
bargain with him, and we exchanged clothes in an unlighted alley among
factories closed for the night. He understood in a bleary way, that I’d
fallen in the water and wanted a dry outfit, which, of course, was the
truth—so far as it went.

“While I was hurriedly disguising myself in this way it suddenly came
to me that my absence, when the passengers disembarked from the steamer
_North Land_ in New York, could hardly fail to be noticed. They’d have
to file between the two ticket takers at the gangway, and pass down
the gangplank under the watchful eyes of the ship’s officers—several
of whom I’d come to know quite well. Harker and his son, leaving the
steamer without me, would be more than likely to cause comment.

“It was then that I happened to think of the night expresses, which
hadn’t left Boston yet and were due in New York two hours or more
before the arrival time of the steamer. Why couldn’t I go back on one
of them and manage, without being seen, to slip aboard the _North Land_
from a rowboat the minute she docked? If I was seen doing this it would
look bad, but no worse than if I wasn’t on the steamer at all. This way
I had a chance—and as the testimony given here has shown, I took it.

“I appreciate the forbearance of the Court in permitting this extended
recital—made, I confess, in the face of a realization that it cannot
save me. But perhaps some time, long after this crowning error in the
rather extended series of police blunders has been committed, the fact
that it _was an error_ may come to light—and——”

No more could be heard, for Mr. McVeigh was on his feet shouting
objections. “I object, Your Honor, and I ask that the reference made by
the accused to the police of this city be stricken from the record and
the Jury instructed to disregard it!”

The Judge spoke in a voice that seemed especially low, coming after the
District Attorney’s vociferous demands.

“That may be stricken out,” he said.

“Will the Court permit me to apologize?” Pentecost asked almost in a
whisper and with evident contrition.

“What’s the sense of that?” snapped McVeigh. “It’s off the
record—that’s all I want!”

But a man face to face with a death sentence is usually permitted some
latitude, and the Judge indicated by a slight motion of the head that
he could do so.

“Permit me then, Your Honor, to say that I regret having made use of
the expressions I did, and certainly would not have done so had I been
aware how sensitive the District Attorney is to the mere mention of
the little spiritistic frolics with the Police Department that have
recently taken place.”

Pentecost had finally got in a reference to the mediumistic phenomena
which had played so amazing a part in the case—something he had
been playing for a chance to do since taking the stand. This man’s
statement before the court that was trying him was undoubtedly one
of the most adroit pieces of pure and unadulterated chicane that
he’d ever attempted—at any rate in that line. To fit an innocent and
sympathetic tale like that to the multitude of incriminating facts
established by the testimony against him;—to bring it out with just the
pathetic hopelessness, exactly the sincerity and precisely the manner
and inflection which would make every point tell and thus inspire
confidence and pity, was something near to marvelous.

He knew well enough that it would do him no good in court, but he
knew, too, that it would do him enormous good where he wanted it. The
statement made little short of a sensation, and not alone with those
who heard it, but with the millions who read it in the newspapers.
To most people, of course, it seemed to explain everything. What if
Pentecost couldn’t prove it? Let the Prosecution _disprove_ it—that was
the thing! How noble of him to say that the State’s witnesses told the
truth—and then show exactly how it _was_! Etcetera,—etcetera.

In court, as I’ve indicated, it was another matter. The only thing Mr.
Brookfield (for the Defense) could do, was to review the contradictions
in which he’d skillfully entangled many of the witnesses for the
prosecution, and end with an eloquent plea for the credibility of the
Pentecost statement which agreed with the testimony given before the
court at every point, and to challenge anyone, in court or out to find
a flaw in it.

The District Attorney, of course, tore it all to pieces. He had
declined to cross-examine the accused “after such a ridiculous and
flimsy tale,” and took care of it in his summing up. The fact is—but no
one was aware of it at the time—he had a decided disinclination to give
the accused any further chances with the Jury.

“Here, gentlemen,” he said in his final argument, “we have an
illustration—even in this extraordinary plan by a master mind in
criminality—of the well-known fact that there’ll always be a weak
spot somewhere—a little matter perhaps, but large enough to wreck the
whole structure. This tale of the accused is based on the claim that
the alibi was never planned beforehand, that it was developed on the
impulse of the moment, an innocent person suddenly finding at eleven
o’clock on the night of the murder that he might be brought under
suspicion if it were known he left the steamer—and so he jumped on
a train and managed to get back to it in time to come off with the
passengers. An inspiration of the moment! Remember that, gentlemen! And
now let us see if it’s the truth that he never thought of it before.
Let us consider the behavior of the accused on previous trips, which,
you will observe, were always made by the same steamer, although there
was another on that line, and although there were three other lines
of Boston boats—a choice of four steamers every day, not to speak of
fifteen or twenty express trains, all bound for the same destination!
But on this steamer _North Land_, which was chosen by the accused as
the theatre in which to perform his alibi, we find from the testimony
of eleven of its officers and crew, that he was sociable and talkative
to the last degree, making acquaintance with everybody who might
thereafter be able to testify that he was on board the vessel on
that fatal night. Contrast this with what four witnesses have sworn
to regarding the usual behavior of this same individual—that he was
naturally silent, taciturn, not easily making acquaintances, not a man
given to sociability, reserved, keeping his affairs to himself, never
discussing them with outsiders,—and there you have it, gentlemen.
He was a different being when on the steamer _North Land_ on those
previous trips, when he was planting his alibi; making himself and his
alleged business of buying inventions known to everybody, jollying over
cigars with the Captain and the Purser—and now telling us on the stand
that he never thought of the alibi until after the murder!”

From this the District Attorney went back and recapitulated every point
made by the prosecution during the trial, showing that not one of them
had been disproved and that there wasn’t even a tremor in the finger of
Justice, now extended, and pointing to the accused, Hugo Pentecost, as
the guilty man.

As McVeigh was nearing the latter part of his closing argument, the
Chief Inspector, followed by a messenger, returned to the court room
and resumed his place at the attorneys’ table. At once he took a sheet
of paper and began writing with evident haste. In a moment he bunched
some papers he had brought with him and put them in a large envelope
with the sheet on which he’d been writing. This packet he handed to the
Court Messenger, who delivered it to the Judge.

Before closing his argument the District Attorney took up the
“impertinent reference” made by the accused before this court to a
series of blunders which he attributed to the Police Department of
Boston, and called the attention of the Jury, and of all who had heard
this slanderous implication, to the fact that there never yet was a
murder case where doubt existed as to the guilty party, which was
without false clues, and mistaken arrests.

From this he proceeded to a violent denunciation of Hugo Pentecost.
“And if this insolent, swaggering fiend in human form” (I got the
wording from the newspaper reports) “who coolly, with careful planning
and infinite calculation, takes the life of an innocent—a gentle—a
defenseless man;—this cowardly assassin who sends two bullets into his
victim from behind, and for no other reason than to get a few thousand
dollars away from him;—if he is now looking for another of those
‘spiritistic frolics’ to stand between him and retribution, he will
look in vain; for even the so-called spirits—whatever they are—can’t
help him now! It’s in your hands, gentlemen, to see that the strong
right arm of the Law is stretched forth and this red-handed assassin is
brought to the punishment he so richly deserves.”

At this point there came to pass one of those curious coincidences—a
real and _bona-fide_ one, for it couldn’t have been laid out beforehand
even by a master-criminal mind, though such a mind may have figured
there was an off chance on it.

For a few moments during the latter part of the District Attorney’s
summing up, the faint but strident calls of an “extra” from far down
Washington Street could have been heard in the court room—a babel
of boyish voices coming through the open windows. This increased
in volume, and as the newsboys came running into Scollay Square
and up into Tremont and Court Streets, there was a sudden burst of
high-pitched shouting, so that following right on Mr. McVeigh’s
climactic outburst, “Even the so-called spirits—whatever they
are—can’t help him now!” came the screams of the newsboys below:
“E-x-t-r-e-e! Spirit message!”—“Spirit Message in the Haworth
Case!”—“E-x-t-r-e-e!”—“Haworth’s Spirit Speaks!”—“Message from
Haworth!”—“E-x-t-r-e-e!” and so on until the shouts grew fainter again
as the boys ran down Sudbury and Hanover Streets toward the North
Station, and West and South on Beacon and Tremont.

       *       *       *       *       *

When the attention of the spectators was again directed to the court
proceedings, they realized that everything had stopped. A consultation
at the Bench was in progress. All the attorneys concerned and the Chief
Inspector were there, evidently having been called up by the Judge.

A peculiar stillness had settled over the place. Charged with
electricity it seemed, the tension increasing every moment. Some
foolish ones wondered if the newsboys, shouting about another spirit
message, could have affected the Court. Once—and not such a time ago
at that—the calling of such a piece of news on the streets would have
excited only derision. None of that now! Even the pooh-poohers had
stopped their pooh-poohing. Too many astounding things!

A sudden straining to see and hear as the Chief Inspector and the
attorneys went back to their places, the Inspector leaving the court
room immediately afterward.

The Judge sat motionless a few moments, apparently in thought. After
that he examined again some of the papers that had been submitted.
Finally he rose and turned to the Jury and the twelve men composing it
came to their feet at the same instant and stood facing him. Then the
Judge, in a voice so subdued that it could scarcely be heard in the
further parts of the room, thanked them for the time and labor they
had contributed to the cause of justice, and proceeded to remind them
that the world we live in is a place of considerable uncertainty, and
that in Courts of Law the unexpected is a frequent—and sometimes a
welcome—visitor.

Everyone could hear him now, which resulted not so much from the
raising of his voice a trifle as from the stillness prevailing. “In the
case before us, gentlemen,” he went on, “the arrival of this visitor,
the unexpected, must be regarded as most opportune, for it is the means
of removing all doubt as to the guilt, or freedom from guilt, of the
accused. Mr. Foreman and Gentlemen: Certain facts have just now been
called to the attention of myself and counsel, which indicate beyond
any question or doubt that this defendant is innocent of the crime with
which he is charged; and I therefore instruct you to bring in a verdict
of Not Guilty.”

A moment later the Clerk of the Court was saying: “Hugo Pentecost,
look upon the Jury; Jurors, look upon the defendant.—Mr. Foreman and
Gentlemen: in the case of the Commonwealth against Hugo Pentecost have
you agreed upon a verdict?”

“We have,” the Foreman answered.

“What say you, Mr. Foreman: is the defendant, Hugo Pentecost, guilty or
not guilty?”

“Not guilty,” answered the Foreman. And after the swearing of the Jury
in the usual form, Hugo Pentecost was informed that he was hereby
discharged and could go “without day” unless held on some other process.

       *       *       *       *       *

On the evening before these final proceedings, and at a time
approaching the hour of midnight, a private “circle” in West
Philadelphia was about to adjourn. Mr. Ernest Everett Blatchford, well
known among the spiritists of that region as a talented and highly
successful materializationist and trance medium, had brought about
during the evening a number of visits from the other side, and in all
but two the spirit had become visible to human eyes—in a shadowy way.

As the director or assistant (I’m not sure what they call those
people) turned to switch on the lights, there came strange muffled
cries issuing from the darkness in the further part of the room, and
a cold musty current of air breathed across the circle of “sitters.”
At the same instant a whitish cloud appeared, faintly wavering in the
darkness. It rapidly grew in size and seemed to be trying to shape
itself into something resembling the human form. Vague suggestions of
a man’s face began to appear in the misty cloudiness, the features
gradually forming themselves, like the fade-in of a picture; and
when, as it came to be more and more distinct, somebody whispered
the name of Charles Haworth, there were several involuntary gasps
of astonishment and a breathless “Oh!” or two could be heard. The
papers had used his picture so often (taken for that first write-up
in a Boston “Magazine Section”) that there was no difficulty about
the recognition after the whispered name had started it. (No one ever
traced that important whisper to its source.)

In a few moments it was seen that the lips of the apparition were
moving—yet no sound came. The cloudlike human form with a face
resembling Haworth’s, was trying to speak.

A voice from somewhere in the circle—a man’s voice—was heard
asking, “Isn’t this Mr. Haworth?” and the head resembling Haworth’s
nodded slowly in affirmation. Almost at once some sort of a sound
was heard—confused and broken, as though pushed through a barrier
that gave way, and after that the spirit began to speak in a low
voice and with what seemed like a sort of eager breathlessness.
“Machine!—Machine!—Machine!” repeated over and over many times more
than that, was what it said, and between two of them a loud whisper
came from somewhere in or near the circle, “It’s Haworth’s voice!”
and an answering whisper, forceful and penetrating, “Yes—oh yes!—_His
own voice!_” So that everybody knew, though they’d never seen the man
Haworth nor heard him speak, that it was he now appearing before them.

For some time the apparition or spirit—if that’s what it was—seemed
unable to utter anything more than this repetition of the word
“Machine,” and the director and some others, although they asked
encouraging questions, proved unable to get anything further.

But again some sort of obstruction was seemingly overcome, for after
many unsuccessful attempts, the voice suddenly broke out with: “In
the wall!—In the wall!—In the wall!—Why don’t they look? It’s there!
The Machine! Find it!—Find it!—Make the court wait!—That man—that
man—nothing—nothing—nothing to do with it—nothing—nothing! Nobody can
hear me in Boston—I can just reach this one—but not for long! Tell them
the wall—inside the wall—that same room—further end—the machine—papers
on the pendulum!—the pendulum!—Papers!—Oh——I’m going!—” (The voice
becoming faint and far away) “—I can’t hold out—and I want to speak to
someone else—oh, I do—I do——” and nothing more could be heard.

The voice was growing weaker and the features were dissolving back
into mistiness even while he spoke; and in a moment there was only
the whitish floating haze which seemed rapidly drawing itself to a
point, at which it wavered for a moment and then flickered out in the
blackness.

No reporters were present at this séance nor were the Philadelphia
police keeping an eye on mediumistic activities; and as it was already
after two in the morning, no one who’d been there took it upon
himself to communicate with anybody as to what had come through. It
was consequently nearly eleven o’clock the following morning before
news of it reached the Boston newspaper offices; and an effort made
later to find out who sent the news met with no success. Whoever it
was completely ignored the police. Not a word of this astounding
communication from the alleged spirit of Charles Haworth was wired or
telephoned to them. Their first intimation that anything of interest
had taken place in West Philadelphia came from the newspaper “extras”
on the streets.

       *       *       *       *       *

The Department—as it had in another and similar instance—got
particulars without giving it away that this was the first they’d
heard of it. And so important did the matter seem that the Inspector
was called out of the court room. And so important did it seem to
the Inspector that he proceeded with the utmost speed and a bunch of
detectives to the Cripps mansion. Reporters were kept outside the line
that had been established.

Within twenty minutes after the Inspector’s arrival with his gang, the
rear end of the wall of the room on the left was what you might call
a near ruin, and a most extraordinary mechanical arrangement that had
been constructed within it was exposed to view.

The first, and it might be said the most striking, thing they had come
upon as they were ripping the lath and plaster away and prying off the
heavy paneling, was a 44 Colt revolver bolted to the studding (the
upright timbers within the wall) just behind one of the panels of the
wainscot, and down within eighteen inches of the floor. It was bolted
so securely as to be absolutely immovable, and was aimed straight out
into the room. The husky plain-clothes man who smashed away the panel
in front of it was seen to spring suddenly to one side.

“Careful now!” the Inspector shouted, as he came running. “Keep away
from that!” he yelled to the other men who were coming over to see. And
they were ordered well to one side while the two working there reached
over and ripped away the panels above and on each side of the one that
had concealed the gun.

It took but a few minutes to expose the whole thing: a simple but
ingenious device built in there for firing two revolvers at nearly the
same instant—discharging them about twelve minutes from the time the
mechanism was set in motion. The second gun, a matter of six inches
below the other, was behind the same panel, but hadn’t been noticed at
first as it was so close to the floor—just clearing the panel frame at
the bottom.

They found that this panel—the one concealing the guns—had been made
to slide up and down, the guides holding it on the inside so there
was no evidence of them in sight; when pushed up, the muzzles of the
revolvers were exposed; when dropped down into place, they were hidden.
And so carefully had this sliding panel been handled that no scratch or
abrasion could be found on its surface, nor did it differ in any way,
so far as appearances went, from the other panels in the wainscoting;
neither did it display the slightest evidence of being movable—which,
indeed, it was not, after the discharge of the revolvers; for on
dropping down into place it automatically locked itself by the swinging
across the top of it, of a block of wood on a pivot—all within the
wall, of course. To get it open again it was necessary to push this
block away _from the inside_.

Both guns were immovably aimed to throw bullets directly across the
middle of the room and out through the upper part of the window at the
front; and as they were set so low down, the course of the bullets
would be upward. A man of a certain height standing at a certain spot
near the center of the room would get the bullet from the upper
revolver through the head and from the lower one through the heart—if
he could stand there long enough after the shot from the first
one—hardly more, probably, than half a second.

The mechanism which—twelve minutes from its starting—fired the
revolvers, and at the same time released the movable panel and allowed
it to slide down into place and automatically to lock itself there, was
an escapement device with a pendulum swinging to seconds. About halfway
of the fifteenth revolution of the escape-wheel (a very large one
carrying fifty teeth or jump-cogs) the powerful springs that connected
with the two rods—one to the trigger of each revolver—were released,
which discharged the guns nearly, but not quite, simultaneously, and
on the next jump of the escape-wheel a lever pulled back the catch
that held the sliding panel up, allowing it to drop down and close the
opening. It locked itself there automatically as I’ve explained.

There were many minor arrangements to safeguard and insure the perfect
operation of the device, such as the weighting (on the inside) of the
sliding panel; the carrying of the rope that unwound from a drum on
the main shaft, up through a pulley at the top, so the heavy weight
attached to it would have room to descend in that space—for of course
it couldn’t go below the floor; the setting of the two revolvers at the
place where the wall of the breakfast room joined this rear wall of the
room on the left, so that, as they were too long for the normal wall
thickness, their butts might project back into the transverse wall.

The whole device had been built in through a large aperture from the
basement below, and on completion of the job this opening was closed
up with the very same old grimy boarding, and even fastened in place
with the same ancient and rusted nails driven into their original
holes, that had been taken out of them. Even the rust on the nail
heads where the hammer would strike them was undisturbed; safeguarded
probably by the use of a cushion of leather or blotting-paper.

It was evident that the machine couldn’t have been set going on its
final performance, _from the basement_, for by no possibility could the
opening down there have been closed with all the care required, within
the twelve minutes between the starting and the automatic discharge
of the guns. Undoubtedly the sliding panel was opened from below and
held open (that is, up) by its catch, and the block above adjusted to
swing in when it next slid down; and after that, at whatever time it
was desired to start the pendulum on its last gruesome swing, it would
only be necessary to reach in through the open panel in the room on the
left, and give it a shove. That was all. There would be twelve minutes
left for reading awhile and then lighting a pipe.

Of course all these small details weren’t figured out by the police
until afterward. The Inspector was there to learn what there was, if
anything, to the latest alleged spirit message, and they found it of
such vital import, too, that it required instant action. No time to be
wasted on conjectures as to the method of starting. There it was——The
Machine! And secured to its great pendulum which, you might say, ticked
Charles Haworth to his death, was the envelope of papers.

Quick investigation followed; the Inspector raced back to town; the
newly discovered evidence was brought to the Judge’s attention; his
conference with the attorneys and the Inspector followed, and after
that came the Court’s instructions to the Jury and the Jury’s verdict
in accordance therewith.

       *       *       *       *       *

The large envelope which they found lashed securely to the great
pendulum contained three instruments or documents—the Last Will and
Testament of Charles Michael Haworth; a Statement made by Charles
Michael Haworth; and an Insurance Policy on the life of Charles Michael
Haworth. The Statement had been sworn to before a Notary Public (of
course without his learning anything of its purport) three days before
Haworth’s death, and was to the effect that he intended within a week
to take his own life and to do it by means of a mechanical contrivance
which he, and he alone, had devised and built for that purpose; that no
one but himself was in any way connected with, or responsible for, this
determination on his part, or involved in its carrying out, for he had
built the device with the utmost secrecy, locking himself into a room
in the basement of the house while at work on it, and allowing no one
to come near. His housekeeper, Mrs. Amelia Temple, had, he stated, been
aware of his labor in this room night and day for nearly two weeks,
though she could have had no knowledge of the character of the work he
was doing; and the butler, James Dreek, could not have been aware that
anything of the kind existed, as he arrived after the completion of the
machine and its sealing up inside the wall.

He then went on to speak of the property he was leaving, mentioning
the eighteen-thousand-dollar Insurance Policy and the thirty-five
thousand dollars which was to be paid him by the firm of Harker &
Pentecost of New York, for one of his inventions which the said firm
had purchased—“a combination gas and compressed-air engine.” Following
that was only a brief paragraph to the effect that a little something
might be realized from the sale of a few pieces of machinery that were
still in his possession—but nothing worth writing down.

The statement ended with that, but he had written a few lines on the
margin three days after it had been signed and sworn to. “This is to
say,” he wrote in a hand without sign of tremor (and it must have been
only a few hours before he reached in and set swinging that pendulum of
death), “that the Messrs. Harker & Pentecost have now paid what was due
me from them ($35,000) which amount (less the sum of $500 that I have
taken from it for a certain present requirement), as it is in bills,
and as Mr. Pentecost has cautioned me that there is danger of robbery,
I have had James Dreek conceal in the stone foundation at the northeast
corner of the barn in the rear of this house.” And to this marginal
memorandum he signed his initials.

The will was simple and brief. After payment of debts, only two
bequests. “To my faithful and beloved friend Amelia Temple” was left
the sum of five thousand dollars—and the statement followed that all
the money in the world could not wipe out the debt he owed her. The
rest of his property went to Edith Carrington Findlay.

       *       *       *       *       *

By this time you are likely to be aware that Mr. Hugo Pentecost of the
firm of Harker & Pentecost, Promoters, had something to do with the
unusual happenings in what might be a trifle incorrectly spoken of as
the Haworth Homicide Case. I’m inclined to doubt, though, whether you
quite appreciate the extent of his work. To say that he was behind
every move in the whole affair comes near to putting it mildly.

When, on his first visit to the mansion, he went down into the basement
with Charles Haworth and got an idea of what the desperate and
half-crazed young man proposed to do, and the instrument with which
he intended to accomplish it, even he, a person never known to be
disturbed by danger, horror, or dilemma of any description, was near
to the experience of amazement. This, though, didn’t prevent him from
jumping in at once and making an earnest effort to dissuade the young
inventor from carrying out his gruesome enterprise. The realization
that Haworth couldn’t be persuaded out of it—indeed, that he was in a
mad frenzy to carry it through if only for the insurance money—struck
Pentecost at about the same time that there flashed into his mind a
most extraordinary “operation” that could be carried on in connection
with it. A born adventurer and intrepid explorer in the shady mazes of
criminality, keen for danger in unusual forms, to be baffled by unusual
and skillfully contrived defenses, with, of course, the chances of a
good haul to make it financially interesting, he was hardly the man to
throw down an unbelievably attractive proposition when he had it in his
hand.

Mr. Harker added his own protests the first time he was at the house on
Torrington Road. He watched his opportunity and got Haworth aside—for
he didn’t want his partner to know what he was up to—and did his best
to induce the young fellow to abandon the grisly idea that seemed to
have taken possession of him.

In the ordinary run of things, the only course left to the firm was
to turn a person having such unlawful designs on himself, over to the
police. But this happened not to be in the ordinary run of things. It
was distinctly extraordinary. Furthermore the firm alluded to wasn’t
in the business of turning unlawfully behaving citizens over to the
police. Quite and much otherwise. And the reason for this was because
it was composed of two conscienceless crime experts, one of them—the
controlling member—a consummate operator in strategic chicanery if
there ever was one on the earth.

       *       *       *       *       *

Neither of the methods that Haworth had in mind for profiting by
the tragic act to which he was apparently driven by some desperate
need, had met the approval of Mr. Pentecost. One was based on a
life insurance policy which the young inventor had recently taken out,
having, by inquiry, found a company which was supposed to pay in such
cases; the other depended on the sale of a motion picture which should
be taken of the actual occurrence—showing not only the operation of the
machine, but, as well, depicting its frightful consequence. But this
master crook had declared himself willing to give both these things
a fair try-out and with every advantage he was able to command, if
the young man would consent, in return, to have his own (Pentecost’s)
extraordinary scheme go into operation. He would play Haworth’s ideas
to the limit, even though it involved the taking of the picture
himself—for he wasn’t going to let any of his men in for a job like
that. The ghastly situation might send any one of them up in the air.

Mr. Pentecost’s scheme, which had struck him like a blow while Haworth
was explaining the working of the Machine, concerned and depended upon
the alleged spirits of the dead, as known through and represented by
persons who called themselves mediums; and it took him into a field
he’d long desired to negotiate—one where the hunting, he happened to
know, was exceedingly good. Furthermore, his astounding method of
handling the mediumistic output involved, was beyond anything dreamed
of before.

You are doubtless acquainted with the fact that information concerning
the lives and the families of more or less prominent people who have
made the crossing to the other side—or who, for various undesirable
reasons, are expected soon to make it—is dealt in by a number of
bureaus or clearing houses for that class of goods. High prices are
paid by their customers (the mediums) for information of value,
and if the bureaus haven’t anything in stock as to the life and
characteristics of a person called for, they have facilities for
getting it without delay.

But this thing of Pentecost’s, although of a decidedly spiritistic
nature, was by no means a matter of information about dead people; on
the contrary, it involved the sale to mediums of information which
dead people could get across—through them—about the living, and under
the most unusual circumstances. That’s where the great mercantile
possibilities came in, the operation of his scheme giving these spirit
communications such astonishing advertising value to mediums who passed
them through, that they’d pay almost any price to get them—if they
had it. In addition to this price down (on delivery as you might say)
he’d take—in each case and for a limited time—a slice of the increased
business which was sure to follow.

It would have been entirely possible to sell out his “spirit
information” in a lump to one of the bureaus, but by handling it
personally he could take advantage of the immense increase in
advertising value as the Haworth case attracted more and more attention.

To give these “messages” or “communications” an enormously high market
value was the object of the entire operation. What such value means
to professional mediums is realized by very few outside of spiritist
circles. I’m referring, of course, to those who practise the methods
alluded to. It has been said that there are others in the spirit game
who go perfectly straight and have a great time believing every word
they say; but if such is the case I don’t know where they live.

A regular—or professional—medium will sometimes make a small
fortune on one skillful (and lucky) performance. To attract wealthy
clients, preferably those who have been hypnotized by the loss of
those who are dear to them—that’s the top of the game. And it’s the
unusual—the extraordinary—manifestations that do it. Taking this
into consideration, you will understand why the Pentecost messages,
before he got through with them, had run up into the twenty and thirty
thousands each. From asking three thousand in Montreal, and six of
Mrs. Belden in Boston, the price went up by jumps of five thousand.
This, together with the rake-off on increased business for two years
from every medium in the game, put Harker & Pentecost nicely to the
good—even though quite vast expenses, including the Haworth money, had
to come out of it.

Using his gang of picked sharps (his correspondents you might call them
in the big cities) Pentecost could cull out the mediums who had the
money, and make his cash sales without difficulty; this same gang also
made prompt payment of percentages as near a certainty as such things
ever come. Extraordinary experiences in misfortune would overtake
anyone in any town or in any part of the country who tried to hold back
on him. And they knew it. It was made strikingly evident to them by the
“agents” who, under instructions, engineered the sales and delivered
the “spirit” messages at the precise time required.

As to the vital matter of secrecy, no leakage could possibly occur, for
the very simple reason that there was nothing to leak. Not a medium in
the lot had the faintest idea where “the goods” came from nor what was
the manner of their origination. Even had one of them known, it would
hardly have been cause for alarm; this owing to the fact that the basic
principle in their guild is the keeping of things dark.

Now you have the key to the whole affair. With it—if you haven’t been
picking the locks as we went along—you gentlemen can let yourselves
in on what the man was playing for at any stage of the game; and how
it came to pass that everybody concerned—public, police, witnesses
for the prosecution, reporters, editors, spiritists, jurors, lawyers,
even the District Attorney himself, and the Chief Inspector with his
choice assortment of plain-clothes men, were dancing for Hugo Pentecost
according as he pulled the strings. What was it if not that? Anyway,
you have the facts—call it what you like. And don’t imagine, when I
speak of this man’s scheme, that this consummate operator had a set
and rigid plan to be followed whether or no. On the contrary, his
arrangements were elastic to an extreme degree. If you’ll notice how it
went, he played each part of the thing _as far as it would safely go_,
and then pulled it back to the line with a voice from the tomb, as you
might say. Where one of several things might happen he had substitute
plays for each, every one carried back to the safety point in whatever
direction it went. Had old Mrs. Temple persisted in her refusal to
testify, notwithstanding the appealing spirit messages he’d carefully
planted, he was ready to work in another witness to the murder, to
Dreek’s being outside the house at the time, and to his own presence in
the room aiming the terrible black object (which was, of course, the
movie camera) at Haworth as the poor fellow stood lighting his pipe. If
the head end trainman hadn’t remembered getting him off the day coach
at the Grand Central Terminal in New York, and had failed to recognize
the boots he had shoved off the seat so many times, there was a waiter
at the lunch counter of the restaurant on the lower level who would
answer all purposes, owing to his (Pentecost’s) unusual behavior while
getting a cup of coffee at that place.

The extreme importance of wrecking the alibi at the time required,
caused him to deal it two simultaneous smashes, either one of which
would have done the trick—barring accident. The boots might not have
been kept in the Lost Property Department of the Eastern Steamship
Lines, Inc. On the bare chance of their having been thrown away,
Operator’s License 2026 would bring the chauffeur into the case; up to
then he could have had no idea that his fare to Boston on that fateful
night was Hugo Pentecost. If Augustus Findlay had failed to take his
revolver with him as he plunged madly away from the house, the fight in
Collamore Street almost directly under Mr. Rathbun’s window would have
gone on just the same; the only readjustment being that Pentecost’s
man would have picked up the gun wherever Findlay dropped it—whether
at the mansion or on the road—and brought it along, making it appear
in the struggle that he got it away from the terrified boob; so there
it would be, finger marks and all, ready to shove up in the water
conductor. And if you imagine that it was any kind of an accident when
Mr. Pentecost tipped up his pocket flashlight and gave the old woman a
glimpse of his face as she came toward him in the pitch-dark room just
after the Machine had done its deadly work; or that the roller shades
being not quite down was a matter of chance; or a hundred and one
things like that, call it off and take a new start.

I saw it troubled both you gentlemen when that carefully constructed
alibi began to crumble. The first thing that occurred to you must
have been an inquiry as to why all the trouble and ingenuity expended
on planting it, if an old pair of boots or an operator’s license was
going to throw it down. But your second thought was undoubtedly quite
different, for unless I’m mistaken, you soon realized that not only
was that fake alibi one of the most effective advertising nuts for
the spirits to crack, but vastly more important than that, it was the
veritable backbone that was to hold up the entire Pentecost operation.
Without it they’d have picked him up that same night or early the next
morning, and the mediums—with the possible exception of Mr. Ernest
Everett Blatchford of West Philadelphia—wouldn’t have had any play at
all.

If you’re financially minded, it might seem unbelievable that
two such seasoned sharps as Harker and Pentecost would let a
thirty-five-thousand bundle of bills go out of their hands with the
chance against them that the Machine might not function or that
Haworth wouldn’t stand up to the grisly game he’d set himself to play.
It wouldn’t be at all surprising if the young fellow, when he got right
up against it, were to go mad; indeed, both partners had a notion he
was half there already. But do you notice that this money never did
go out of their hands—that, as the crucial time approached, Pentecost
had Dreek outside the house where he could instantly seize on it at a
signal from inside—and that he himself was inside?

But neither this nor the taking of the motion picture accounted so
much for Pentecost’s presence in the room at the crucial moment
as the absolute necessity of his being seen there by a competent
witness in order to make the case against him have the look of being
incontestable. His trial for murder was the final play, and he’d begun
laying lines for it at his very first interview with the Inspector,
adroitly behaving, on that occasion, in a manner calculated to awaken
the suspicion that he’d been connected in some way with the crime,
even though the alibi—at that time unshaken and to all appearances
unshakable—blocked any idea of his having committed it himself.

I won’t go any further with small details as to Pentecost’s methods
of operation. But I’ll ask you to take it from me that from the time
he staggered—to all appearances a semi-intoxicated coal heaver or
something like that—into telephone booth 19 at the South Station in
Boston, just before boarding the night train for New York, and calling
up Pemberton Square (that is to say, headquarters) told the official in
charge that a man named Pentecost who was supposed to have embarked for
New York that afternoon on the Steamer _North Land_ had been seen near
the Haworth house just before the murder that evening, and suggested
that it might be a good idea to have the New York police verify this
on arrival of the steamer there (thus, as you’ll see, making his alibi
official in a certain sense by bringing in the New York detectives
as witnesses to it), to the moment of his having himself put on the
witness stand and reciting his fake statement before the court, his
hand never for one instant left the throttle.

Notwithstanding all this, he found time, during that stressful period,
without personally appearing in the matter or indeed ever meeting
her, to have everything possible attended to for Edith Findlay. All
things tending to her comfort and well-being were arranged for: a nurse
brought from the hospital to take care of her and manage everything
about the house; Augustus Findlay permanently eliminated by having such
a fright thrown into him that the entire continent of North America was
thenceforth relieved of his weight upon it, with South America standing
a good chance of equal immunity; and finally (it was some weeks before
the Pentecost trial came on) her departure, with little Mildred and two
nurses, to one of the most highly recommended places in the Austrian
Alps.

       *       *       *       *       *

At once after his acquittal Mr. Pentecost did his best—as he’d promised
Haworth he would—with the $18,000 life insurance and the more than
gruesome “movie”—which he had himself taken. The former he succeeded
in collecting after a campaign of sharp practice devoted to it; the
latter—as he’d figured from the start—stood no chance with censors
and the inter-state people. He got a few thousand for it from the
“bootleggers” of padlocked films who smuggle them across state lines
and put them in the “private show” programs. These things, with the
$51,000, and odd which was Haworth’s share on his percentage of profits
on the game, more than doubled the total of deposits to the credit of
Edith Findlay in the bank which had been designated to take care of her
property. While no mention of this percentage was made in the contract
between Haworth and the firm, it was one of those things that Pentecost
would have paid though it reduced him to penury.

When you say—as you’re more or less liable to if I give you the
chance—that this man was a surprising combination of characteristics,
you will have spoken the truth. Not quite so surprising, though, when
you come to reflect that every man is that—more or less—if he has any
characteristics worth considering.

And while we’re speaking of it, it’s just as well for you to know that
the man was taking all this care of Edith Findlay’s interests—as well
as of Edith Findlay herself, solely and entirely because of Haworth.
Something about the fellow had appealed to him in a peculiar way.

As the matter stood there was no possibility of Edith’s ever knowing
that the money coming to her—aside from the insurance—was other than
the amounts realized from the sale of one of Haworth’s mechanical
inventions. This was shown by Haworth’s contract with the firm and by
the receipt he gave for the cash payment, as well as implied in his
statement and will. The tragic truth of the matter, which might have
affected her disastrously both mentally and physically, as well as
undoubtedly preventing her from touching a penny of the inheritance,
was safely locked up with the firm of Harker & Pentecost.

For several months all went well. According to the doctors there,
Edith’s condition was improving. Then a cable that was rather
disquieting. A slight turn for the worse. Probably only temporary. Must
expect ups and downs.

This talk about temporary ups and downs was nothing to Pentecost. He
found, after some drastic searching, a high-up specialist who would
go over. He felt that an American patient ought to have an American
doctor. Whatever you say, races are different and need different
treatment.

He met the doctor at the steamer on his return and they had a talk in
the latter’s cabin while the baggage was coming off. The gist of the
physician’s report was that while Mrs. Findlay was in a much better
condition as far as the disease itself was concerned, and ought to go
right on improving, her present mental activity was holding her back.
This had not been the case heretofore, as the shock of the affair had,
in a certain sense, stunned her. For several months she seemed hazy
about it all, but recently things were becoming clearer to her, which
was unfortunate. Everything was being done to divert her mind, but it
was an obstinate case—she didn’t want it diverted.

“What does she want?” Pentecost inquired.

“Well—it amounts to this: She’s made up her mind to die and so far
there’s no shaking her determination.”

“I wish I had her here,” said Pentecost.

Two weeks after that a cable reached him signed by Edith Findlay
herself, begging him to come over as soon as he possibly could—utmost
importance that she see him before the end, which was near.

He was on the next steamer going out.

Mr. Pentecost was sitting by the side of her bed. The nurse had told
her his name before he came in, but for quite a time she couldn’t
remember who he was or why he was there. Perceiving this, the nurse
came in from the adjoining room and explained that it was the gentleman
who’d been so kind in attending to everything for her, and that he’d
come all the way from New York because she’d asked to see him.

“Oh, you—you came from America!” Her voice was faint and far away.

He said “Yes” softly.

The nurse had retired again to the next room.

“Did——” Edith glanced about searching for some one—then her eyes came
back to him. “Did he come with you?”

“No.”

“Isn’t that strange!” She spoke hardly above a whisper. “Oh, it _is_ so
strange! But he’s coming! He’s coming just as soon as he sets up the
machine and regulates it—that was in the contract you know!”

“Yes Mrs. Findlay, but it’ll take quite a while yet.”

“Oh, will it? It seems so long! I can’t understand why they keep him so
long!”

“You mustn’t worry yourself about it.”

“Oh no—no, I mustn’t! But it does seem as if they’d be through by
this time!” She lay quiet for a little—her eyes closed. Then suddenly
turning her head on the pillow she looked at him again.

“How long did it take to get here?” she asked.

“Ten days, but I didn’t get a very fast steamer.”

“Yes, I see. Maybe he took a slow one. But I’m expecting him very soon
now—very soon.”

She went on for a little, asking questions about the detention of
the one she expected—the length of time it would take to regulate the
machine he’d sold—whether a fast steamer would be leaving when it
was finished, and other fancies like that, to all of which Pentecost
replied briefly and in a low voice. He was waiting his chance.

She’d been lying back against the pillows, but rather suddenly in the
midst of her questioning she stopped and sat up erect in the bed,
staring at him. “Oh——” she finally breathed. “I thought you—I didn’t
know——Are you Mr. Pentecost?”

“Yes, Mrs. Findlay.”

“They—they said so, but I didn’t seem to——” She glanced about,
thinking; then her eyes were fixed on him again. “You were so good to
come,” she whispered painfully.

He saw that the merciless memories were coming back to her.

“You—you can be such a help to me—if you will—such a help! It’s
something that——” She broke off, and raising her head a little from the
pillow, glanced at the door into the nurse’s room. “Would you shut it,
please?”

Pentecost carefully closed the door—then returned to his chair by her
side.

“I want to ask you to do something for me, Mr. Pentecost—because—you
see—they think I’m going to get well—but it isn’t so—no,” (shaking her
head a little on the pillow) “it isn’t so.”

Pentecost sat looking at her with a peculiar glint in his prominent
eyes, but said nothing.

“I tell you,” she went on after a momentary pause, “because you—you’re
the only one I can trust.”

“Where did you get that idea?”

“_He_ told me. It was in a letter he left. He said you were his friend,
the only friend he had except the old woman who took care of him, and
that I must trust you in everything.”

“In view of this, Mrs. Findlay, tell me in what way I can be of
service?”

“Mr. Pentecost, what will become of my little Mildred?”

“It strikes me” (in a suddenly sharp, penetrating voice) “you’re the
one to answer that.”

She looked at him in amazement.

“I?” she finally asked in a faint voice.

“Who else?” he inquired. “Aren’t you the one who’s proposing to abandon
her?”

“Abandon——!” (With a slight gasp.) “Why——How——You don’t mean——”

“Well what would you call it?”

“No—no—no! Oh, wait! Let me tell you!” (With all her earnestness she
could hardly do more than whisper.) “Oh, I couldn’t stay—I don’t want
to!” She shook her head a little on the pillow. “He’s gone—gone! The
thought of it is killing me. I want to go. I want to be where he is!”

“How do you know where he is?” Pentecost’s voice cut in like a knife.

She stared at him in astonishment.

“My religion tells me that, Mr. Pentecost,” she whispered, reverently.

“And does this religion of yours omit to tell you where your daughter
is?”

“Oh yes—yes!—that’s why I wanted to see you. That’s why I——” She broke
off and glanced distressfully about the room.

“You seem to have made up your mind to leave her,” Pentecost observed.

Edith was silent.

“Aren’t the living of some consequence,” he went on, “or is it only the
dead we have to consider?”

“No no—that’s wrong! I hadn’t forgotten her! Oh, how can you _think_
such a thing, when it was about her that I wanted to see you—just about
her—nothing else!”

“What can _I_ do?”

“I hope—I hope you’ll consent to take her—to take care of her! I don’t
know who else to ask—and he told me to trust in you—about everything.
If I can only know she’ll be with you I shall die happy!”

Pentecost suddenly turned and blazed out upon her—something as he used
to do in the Chicago days when he leaped, tigerlike, on a victim in the
witness stand.

“What is it to me whether you die happy or not! Whatever I can do in
this affair I’m doing on account of someone else—not for you Mrs.
Findlay! You cut no figure with me—why in God’s name should you? I’ve
never laid eyes on you before—and now I come to see you it looks to
me like a cursed low-down play you’re making, that while I’m doing
my best to carry out everything he wanted, you’re lying here doing
_your_ best to block his game! That’s just what you’re doing, Mrs.
Findlay,—pitching the fulfillment of his most vital wish into the
discard!”

“Why I——Why you——” She couldn’t go on.

“Look, then—look at this! The one thing in the world he wanted money
for—the reason he was mad and crazy and demented to sell his machine
and get it, was so he could send you here and do everything on earth to
save your life! He lived for that—nothing else—it was the one thought
that possessed him! He made a will to make it certain that—if anything
happened to him—the money would be used for that and nothing else. And
after all this—which you know as well as I do, I come over here and
find you deliberately throwing away all he worked for and hoped for
and—for all I know—prayed for. Of course if you’re bound to go against
it I’ll do what I can about the child—though God knows the little one
needs you. It all rests with you, Mrs. Findlay. The head medical sharp
that came over, tells me it isn’t the disease that’s killing you—it’s
yourself. He says you’ve made up your mind to die—you’re determined to
do it—and that play’s certainly going to take the trick if you sit in
the game long enough. It’s up to you to quit that if you want to do the
right thing by the dead——and by the living.”

Pentecost rose and took her thin little hand in his. “I’ll say good-by,
Mrs. Findlay,” he said in an altered tone. “They’ll keep me informed”
(motioning toward the nurse’s room) “of which way the cards fall, and
I’ll act accordingly.”

As he reached the door he thought he heard her call to him faintly, and
went back to see if it was so. She was looking up at him as he stood by
the bed, and tried to speak—but only her lips moved. He bent nearer to
catch what she said.

“I’ll try,” she whispered.

He took her hand again.

“There’s some sense to that Mrs. Findlay,” he said; and after looking
down into her eyes a moment he laid her hand back on the coverlet
where he’d found it, and quietly left the room.

It was still early enough to get the afternoon train out—which he did.

       *       *       *       *       *

A few days short of a month after Mr. Pentecost’s brief visit to the
Austrian Alps, he walked, one wintry afternoon, into the office of the
firm, having come direct from a trans-Atlantic steamer—just docked.
Wasting no more time on salutations than he usually did—which was
precisely none at all, he quickly got Harker into the small inner
office—sometimes referred to by the staff as the dissecting room—and
after pushing him into a chair and drawing one for himself close to it,
began talking to him in tones that were subdued to the limit.

“We’re moving the office to London,” he said, “—and inside of
twenty-one days. I’ve got something I want to put on over there. I’ll
need most of the office force—especially Finch Dugas—and I’m taking
eleven of the boys.” (By which he meant his “trusties.”)

“What’s the matter,” Harker inquired; “can’t you play it with the
natives?”

“You’re dippy! Hasn’t the Yard got their numbers?”

“Sure—the Yard’s got everything. And take it from me if you’re going up
against that layout you’ve got to watch your step and then some!”

“Now, Roxy—you’ve hit on the one thing that’s doing the pull on me. As
I was over on that side I thought I’d come home by way of London and
take a look around. While I was doing it a little something crossed my
mind that looked to me as if it might interest ’em. That being so, we
play it.”

“Don’t say _we_. Maybe _you’ll_ play it, I don’t know; but if this
London scheme you’re pulling off is one of your favorite flirtations
with the undertaker, I declare myself out of it here and now. I can get
myself nicely hung in the U. S. A. without going abroad for it—and I’d
just as soon patronize home industries.”

“Not a killing to it I give you my word,” Pentecost assured him. “We
play a corpse for two or three moves, but it’s handed to us—no chance
of a line across—they’ll have the guy that did it. Now every one of
us comes in from different places—I go round and get across from
Stockholm—you and Dugas make it from Rio—plenty of time as you don’t
play in till near the finish. Kennedy makes it from Holland—” and he
went on laying out the “game” with Harker to the uttermost detail.

Three days later Pentecost (but not _as_ Pentecost) embarked on a
Swedish-American Line steamer. Harker was at the dock getting final
instructions (of course he was going in on it as Pentecost knew he
would), and there was a vast lot of things to do in a limited time.

The two stood talking on the pier, hidden by piled-up crates and boxes,
yet only a short distance from the gangplank so that Pentecost could go
on board at the last moment. When they had about finished up matters
connected with the London “operation,” Harker happened to think of
something.

“Oh—by the way,” he said; “how was that lady you went over to see?”

“Not so well,” Pentecost muttered in a way that suggested aversion to
talking about it.

But Harker, not affected by this, cheerfully pursued the subject.

“Going to die?” he asked.

“Had it all fixed to.” (Speaking very shortly.)

“Who? Who do you mean had it fixed?”

“She did.”

“Oh—I see—she wanted to.”

“Yes, and her wanting was _doing_ it. The doctors were hunting some way
to shake her up, and left it to me. So I went in and gave her a jolt or
two that might change her mind.”

“What did you say?”

“Anything I could grab off the line.”

“Then she’s going to get well, is she?”

“How the hell do I know?”

Pentecost had put an end to the subject with that, but after a silence
of some little time, he went on,—and Harker took notice of a most
unusual softness in his voice.

“D’you know what I’d do, Hark, if I had it to do again—that is, if I
knew what it was that was eating him?”

Harker—surprised at his tone—kept his eyes on him for the answer.

“I’d ’a’ framed that Findlay soak for a twenty-year jack in a nice cool
cell, and then staked those two out in the mountains—or wherever it was
she had to go.”

“I thought you did know.”

“Not till too late. It was in a letter he left for me with Jamie Dreek.”

The two stood looking at one another.

“Well,” said Harker after a brief silence; “what’s the good of post
mortems?”

Pentecost nodded. “What’s the good?” he muttered.

A moment later he was hurrying on board, and with that came the end of
this “Pentecost Episode.”

       *       *       *       *       *

  _I take the liberty of adding a brief statement._

  H. McC.

Dudley sat smoking heavily and abstractedly after Mr. Barnes had
finished a few business details with me, and after shaking hands with
both of us, had gone. I was to take a night express for New York, as my
time was up. We’d just got it in on the ten-day limit.

I saw that Duds had something on his mind—puffing away at his pipe and
staring down at the floor—so, as there was plenty of time before my
train I let him alone. He looked up at me after a wink, in the manner
of rousing himself.

“D’you know who that was that just went out?” he asked.

“What?—Oh!—Why Barnes of course!”

“No.” He shook his head. “Not Barnes of course, but some one else of
course. I’ve been keeping a few tabs on the man that’s been telling us
all this stuff, and there’s four things—with a possibility of five—that
no one on earth could know but Hugo Pentecost.”

“Good Lord!... Why ... then you think——”

“That’s it—I think.—But I’m going to make sure. He’s in town yet. I’ll
drop you a line to-morrow.”

The “line” reached me a couple of days later.

“It _was_ Pentecost,” was the statement it began with. And went on:
“That is, I mean it was the man that was—he’s something else now. He’s
in business abroad, and taking a steamer from here. His agent (or
‘trusty’ if you like) is going to get the manuscript from you when you
write it out. Take my advice and put in all this at the end of the
thing. It needs some sort of a finish, and this might do. If he doesn’t
like it he can cut it out when he gets the proof—and you can bet he’ll
get it.

“Couldn’t make him tell the sort of an enterprise he’s on over
there—says maybe he will sometime.

“It seems the girl—Edith Findlay—is making a slow recovery. I asked him
how the book would affect her if she got hold of it, and he said it
wouldn’t do her any harm by then. ‘And by God!’ he went on, ‘it’s just
as well for her to know—now she’s able to stand it—that such a man as
Charles Michael Haworth went happily and eagerly to his death, so that
she might live. You’d think she might run through her life on that, and
ask for nothing more. But probably not.’”

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
