    "* An algorithm is a set of steps for solving a problem or performing a computation.\n",
    "* Algorithms are different than the _implementation_, or specific code used to solve a problem.\n",
    "    * There can be many different ways to implement an algorithm. Different pieces of code can all solve the problem correctly.\n",
    "* When approaching a coding problem or task, it is usually helpful to write out the algorithm first, so that you know the set of steps you need to follow.\n",

    "\n",
    "For each exercise, there is a set of \"tests\" for the solutions. Once you define your function, you can run these tests to see if it works. If you run the code block with the assertions and \"nothing happens\", that means they passed and your solution is correct. If you get an `AssertionError`, something went wrong, and you should inspect the specific test case that failed and try to see where your algorithm went wrong."
