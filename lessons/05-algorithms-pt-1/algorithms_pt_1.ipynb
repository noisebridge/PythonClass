    "Most interesting programs contain some implementations of algorithms, big and small. The important thing to remember is that the algorithm is the abstract set of steps used to solve a problem, and the implementation is the code that does the job. When writing your programs, try to think about the full set of steps (the algorithm) that you need, before you start writing code. That way you will at least be confident that once you figure out the right lines to put down, you have a finished solution. Otherwise, you will be writing code, that may itself be buggy, and not know if you're any closer to solving the problem."
