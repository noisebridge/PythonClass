However, it is still in a very early stage, and there is a lot of work to do.<p>One of my friends encouraged me to post about it here, since he felt people might find interesting how I don’t use any libraries for it.<p>The game can be played on a browser by virtue of WebAssembly. There are native ports using either MiniFB or SDL2, but you have to build those yourself.<p>I decided to write the game in C because I feel like it is a simple language that a lot of people can understand well enough, and I didn’t think I needed anything more involved or complicated.<p>Over time, the game’s code became complicated, and I decided to use advanced features such as coroutines and higher order procedures, besides general overly engineered abstractions.<p>But then, over time I grew to feel like a lot of those abstractions didn’t really add anything to it, and just made it more complicated (and oftentimes more buggy) than it really needed to be, so a few weeks ago, I made a significant refactoring to it to remove all of those abstractions without removing almost any features from the game.<p>Milestones are released effectively whenever I get the game’s code to a decently presentable state. Sometimes, this means there are a lot of changes and big refactorings, but sometimes it means there are only a few small changes.<p>The game uses a simple 2D model system to generate images for the character’s animations dynamically during initialisation. (The source code can be browsed using a web browser on its page.)<p>The character can be controlled using the arrow keys or “WASD” (“A” and “D”) (double-tap a direction to jump).",,,https://zamfofex.neocities.org/mimimi/,125,Show HN: My platforming game written in C 89,43

There&#x27;s a warning that says Meta suspects unauthorized access to my Instagram account, and directs me to change my password.<p>3. When I follow the directions, I see Meta account account settings. However, everything is in Swedish, which I don&#x27;t speak, and don&#x27;t use.

Whenever I notice that I don&#x27;t make a lot of progress, either by procrastinating or something else, I&#x27;m falling back to time-boxing my tasks. While ideally I&#x27;d love to get everything done in 15 minutes, sometimes things take longer. But what I noticed is that stepping back usually helps you to accelerate. If something takes longer than 15 minutes, I do at least one other task in between, before I resume work on that particular task.<p>Sometimes I also squeeze more than one thing into 15 minutes. In this case I&#x27;m starting my first 15 minutes block of the day writing this post, but also assembling a task list for the day.<p>I will also try to keep posting my tasks here, but I might sometimes not do it for a few days.
