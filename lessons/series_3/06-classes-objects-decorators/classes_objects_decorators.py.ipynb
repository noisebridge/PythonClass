So in the above example, `Fruit` is the *class*, `a` is the *object*, and it is constructed using the syntax `Fruit('apple', 1.49)`. When a class is called in this way and an object is constructed, the special `__init__` (double underscore init) method is called. This method is the constructor, which is similar in purpose to constructors in other OOP languages.\n",

Objects don't need to have the same set of properties defined during their lifetime, and we have already seen an example of this.
