So in the above example, `Fruit` is the *class*, `a` is the *object*, and it is constructed using the syntax `Fruit('apple', 1.49)`. When a class is called in this way and an object is constructed, the special `__init__` (double underscore init) method is called. This method is the constructor, which is similar in purpose to constructors in other OOP languages.\n",

The Python interpreter saw the **decorator** called `property`(the @ sign is just how the decorator is invoked) and extended the behavior of the decorated function in some way.
