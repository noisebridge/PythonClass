There are at [least three separate ways](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#fancier-output-formatting) to do string formatting in Python, but the most commonly used in modern code is **f-strings**. An f-string is a normal string (`'This is a string'` and `\"This is also a string\"`) with a single `f` character before the opening quote. Inside of an f-string, anything in curly braces will be evaluated as Python code (most commonly, a single value) and converted to a string, which gets \"replaced\" in the string exactly where the braces were."

    "In almost every programming language, code is laid out line by line in a text file. Programmers use **whitespace** (spaces, tabs, and newlines primarily) to separate the logical parts of a function. In some languages, like C++ and Java, you can have as much or as little whitespace as you want, the language doesn't care.\n",
