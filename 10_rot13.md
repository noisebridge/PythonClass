This is a practical project. It explores text manipulation. However, don't get caught up in the text manipulation. The learning goals are code organization and how to break down different parts of an application.

The objective is to extend the functionality of the provided library to achieve the stated goals.    
    
Feel free to use getsocrata for examples of argparse and configparser if you decide to use those modules.    
    
    
    
Goals:    
    
1. Allow a file to be passed via standard input on program execution (as a parameter). The output can go to stdout or to a file via another standard input parameter, however you determine is best.    
2. Change the primary/main function to be a standard input loop accepting lines of input, respecting the ability to provide a file on execution as a separate mode.    
3. Add a new function for rotating by an arbitrary integer over 62 characters rather than 26. You'll need a separate cleaner function for this, since the default string cleaner doesn't allow caps or numbers. The 62 characters are a-z A-Z and 0-9.
