#### Lesson notes

Running notes of interesting and new things that get mentioned during lessons.

Each night we should have a note taker who will be responsible for committing these notes. The note taker should have sat in on the lesson at least once. This isn't always possible, so focus on your personal development first, the notes can afford to suffer.

##### These lesson notes should never have a critique of any person giving lessons.


##### Things that belong in these lesson reviews:
- Improvements to the course materials, examples, or lesson plan
- Ideas for an extension course or project based on the source material
- Modules and things mentioned offhand during the class that may be of interest


##### Things that do not belong in the lesson reviews:
- Any critique or review of the instructor, the notes are about content


#### YOUR NOTES MUST MAKE SENSE TO OTHER READERS!
