== PSAs and Events ==

''' PSA 8-19-14: ''' The [https://noisebridge.net/wiki/PyClass noisebridge wiki] and [https://github.com/PyClass/PyClass-lesson-plans github readme] files now have parity to each other.

''' PSA 8-16-14: '''  The new curriculum for the Noisebridge PyClass is a crash course in the Python standard library, also touching on modules that are popular but not quite part of the standard modules.   Scroll down to see the course list.

== Scheduled Weekly Meeting Times ==
* Tuesday 7:00 - 9:00 PM PST - 'Turing' Classroom
* Wednesday 7:00 - 9:00 PM PST - 'Church' Classroom

== Class Description, Goals, and Ideal Student ==

The pace of the courses will be fast, and the materials will be available online 24/7. We plan to frequently repeat modules with new twists as we iterate over course materials.

A major PyClass is to break down the courses into independent units. In other words, you won't fall behind if you miss a week. Sounds good, right?

To best experience the course, spend a short time reviewing the course materials before you come in. If you wish to know this week's courses, please join the mailing list and send an email out to PyClass@googlegroups.com

The ideal student for this course can grasp the following code (feel free to use web resources to look up anything you don't understand):

<source lang="python">

word_frequency_dict = {}
word = "noisebridge"

for letter in word:
    times = word_frequency_dict.get(letter, 0)
    times += 1
    word_frequency_dict[letter] = times
    
</source>

== Course List ==

The order of the following courses has not yet been determined.  

Please [http://groups.google.com/group/pyclass ask on the mailing list] if you want to know what courses are coming this week!

== OS / Environment / Versions ==

This section is under development.

For the sake of our sanity we use Python 2.7.1+ for this course.

Emergency Python Command Line: http://repl.it/languages/Python

Installing Python with [http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python!]

We accept refugees using all operating systems. You will be politely prodded in the direction of solutions that are closer to posix standards: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#Mostly_POSIX-compliant

Emergency Python Command Line: http://repl.it/languages/Python

Some routes:
# Install a linux virtual machine on another computer using virtualbox.
# Use the command line in your apple machine.
# Explore POSIX for windows: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX#POSIX_for_Windows

Another critical tool is git:
* Windows: http://git-scm.com/download/win
* Mac: http://git-scm.com/download/mac
* Linux: (use your package manager)

== Legacy Materials 2011-2014 (Liz & Kellan's Class) ==

''' The following material is old material from Kellan and Liz's long-running PyClass: '''


'''Come learn [http://www.python.org/ Python]'''!!<br>
See our awesome website for both PyClasses at [http://pycourse.com/ Noisebridge Learning Python]


After 9pm Tuesdays, we'll have open hacking time and time for questions for those that are kicking so much ass they just can't go home yet, or even for those that may have gone to Mondays' Front-end Web Development class and want to come back for more. If you have problems from work or home, feel free to bring them after 9 and everyone can help each other.
