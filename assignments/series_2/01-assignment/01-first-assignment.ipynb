How does this compare to the problem of counting the number of occurrences of letters in a string?

What **control structures** (`if` statements, `for` loops) will you need to use to solve this problem?\n",

    "1. In your Jupyter Notebook (this website), go to File -> Download as -> Notebook (.ipynb)\n",
