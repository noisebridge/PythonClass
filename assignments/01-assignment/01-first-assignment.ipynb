    "Before you start writing any code, think about the **algorithm** you will use to solve this problem. How does this compare to the problem of counting the number of occurrences of letters in a string? How will you know if a word has been seen before, if the letters are all jumbled the next time you see it? What **control structures** (`if` statements, `for` loops) will you need to use to solve this problem?\n",

    "1. In your Jupyter Notebook (this website), go to File -> Download as -> Notebook (.ipynb)\n",
